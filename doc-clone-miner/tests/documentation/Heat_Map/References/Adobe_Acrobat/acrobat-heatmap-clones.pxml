Chapter 2: Workspace

Workspace basics
Workspace overview
Adobe Acrobat DC user interface has three views - Home, Tools, and Document.
Further, the Document view can have one of the two interfaces - Single Document Interface (view one document at a
time) or Multiple Document Interface (tabbed interface for multiple PDFs viewing).
Home This is the gateway or the landing page when you don’t have a PDF opened in Acrobat DC.
Tools This is the go to place to discover the tools that’s available in Acrobat DC. All Acrobat DC tools are shown in this

view.
Document This is the default view whenever a document is opened in Acrobat DC. When you open multiple

documents, each document opens as a tab in the same application window.

Home view
This is the gateway or the landing page when you don’t have a PDF opened in Acrobat. When you launch Acrobat or
Reader, you see a welcome message with the Learn More button pointing to a quick introduction document.
The Home view displays file lists and storage accounts.
• File Lists: Shows Recent and Sent files views. All your recently accessed files are displayed in the Recent files
view, and all the files that you sent using Adobe Send &amp; Track and Send for Signature are displayed in the Sent
files view.
• Storage: It lists various places or accounts from which you can open and work on files from within Acrobat or
Reader
• My Computer, Document Cloud, and Add Account(a SharePoint or Dropbox account).

Recent files view
In the Recent files view, you can see your recently used files, and also sync them across devices using the Mobile Link
option at the bottom of the middle pane. For a selected file, a details panel appears on the right showing a thumbnail
preview of the file, its location, and a list of frequently used tools.

Last updated 5/10/2016

18
Workspace

For local files, you can click the location in the details panel to open the folder in Explorer. However, you cannot open
the location if it’s Adobe Document Cloud or Dropbox.
The Remove from Recent option in the details panel allows you to selectively remove files from the Recent files list.

Sent files view
In the Sent files view, you can track and manage your sent files online. The available options are displayed when you
choose a file in the right pane. You can also manage your files sent for signature using the Manage Document Sent for
Signature link at the bottom in the right pane.

Last updated 5/10/2016

19
Workspace

Storage - Document Cloud, Dropbox, and SharePoint
Storage lists offline and online places from where you can access your files. Apart from your local computer, you can
access files:
• Stored securely in Adobe Document Cloud using the Document Cloud link in the left pane.
• From your online accounts, such as Dropbox and Microsoft SharePoint. You can add SharePoint or
Dropbox accounts using the Add Account link in the left pane. For more information, see Working with
online storage accounts in Acrobat DC.

Tools center
This is the go to place to navigate and discover tools available in Acrobat/Reader. All the tools are listed by categories.
When you choose a tool, the tool-specific commands or toolbar appears in the document view if a file is opened.
You can also open some tools even without opening a document. If the tool requires a document to be open, choosing
a tool prompts you to select a document.

Last updated 5/10/2016

Workspace

Note: A new custom tool is displayed in the Customize category. All third-party plug-ins are displayed in a new category
named Add-ons.

Add or remove shortcuts of tools in the right pane
To add a shortcut of a tool in the right pane, click the Add button below the tool name.

To remove the shortcut of a tool from the right pane, click the Down Arrow button next to Open below the tool name,
and then choose Remove Shortcut.

Last updated 5/10/2016

21
Workspace

Alternatively, to remove the shortcut, click the cross button for the shortcut in the right pane.

Document view
By default, you see tabbed interface for multiple PDFs viewing. When you open multiple PDFs, each PDF opens as a
tab in the same application window. You can switch among the tabs from the top – tab name shows the name of the file
opened in the tab. A previous button and a next button are displayed towards right to navigate through document tabs
when the number of documents are high and don’t fit the document view.
The menu bar and the toolbar are visible at the top of the work area. The work area for the stand-alone application
includes a document pane in the middle, a navigation pane on the left, and tools or task pane on the right side. The
document pane displays PDFs. The navigation pane on the left side helps you browse through the PDF and perform
other options on PDF files. Toolbars near the top of the window provide other controls that you can use to work with
PDFs.

Last updated 5/10/2016

22
Workspace

If you want to switch off the tabbed view and go back to the single document view, go to Edit &amp;gt; Preferences &amp;gt; General,
and then clear the checkbox for the preference - Open documents as new tabs in the same window (requires restart).
Restart Acrobat.

Menus and context menus
Ordinarily, it’s a good idea to keep the Acrobat menus visible so that they are available as you work. It is possible to hide
them, using the View &amp;gt; Show/Hide &amp;gt; Menu Bar command. However, the only way to display and use them again is by
pressing F9 (Windows) or Shift+Command+M (Mac OS).
Unlike the menus that appear at the top of your screen, context-sensitive menus display commands related to the active
tool or selection. You can use context menus as a quick way to choose commonly used commands. For example, when
you right-click the toolbar area, that context menu displays the same commands as the View &amp;gt; Show/Hide &amp;gt; Toolbar
Items menu.
1 Position the pointer over the document, object, or panel.
2 Click the right mouse button.

Note: (Mac OS) If you don’t have a two-button mouse, you can display a context menu by pressing the Control key as you
click with the mouse.

Viewing PDFs and viewing preferences
The initial view of the PDF depends on how its creator set the document properties. For example, a document may open
at a particular page or magnification.
Note: The Organizer and Organizer-related commands are not available in Acrobat X and later.

View PDFs in Read mode
When you’re reading a document, you can hide all the toolbars and task panes to maximize the viewing area on your
screen.
The basic reading controls, such as page navigation and zoom, appear in a semi-transparent floating toolbar near the
bottom of the window.

• To open Read mode, choose View &amp;gt; Read Mode, or click the Read Mode button
corner of the toolbar.

in the upper-right

• To restore the work area to its previous view, choose View &amp;gt; Read Mode again. You can also click the close button
in the floating toolbar.
Note: Read mode is the default viewing mode when you open a PDF in a web browser.

View PDFs in Full Screen mode
In Full Screen mode, only the document appears; the menu bar, toolbars, task panes, and window controls are hidden.
A PDF creator can set a PDF to open in Full Screen mode, or you can set the view yourself. Full Screen mode is often
used for presentations, sometimes with automatic page advancement and transitions.

Change the PDF/A viewing mode
PDF/A is an ISO standard for long-term archiving and preservation of electronic documents. Documents you scan to
PDF are PDF/A-compliant. You can specify whether you want to view documents in this viewing mode.
When you open a PDF/A compliant document in PDF/A viewing mode, the document is opened in Read mode to
prevent modification. A message is displayed in the document message bar. You will be unable to make changes and
add annotations to the document. If you turn off PDF/A mode, you can edit the document.
1 In the Preferences dialog box under Categories, select Documents.
2 Choose an option for View Documents In PDF/A Mode: Never, or Only For PDF/A Documents.

You can switch in or out of PDF/A viewing mode by changing this preference setting.
For a video on working with PDF/A files, see www.adobe.com/go/learn_acr_pdfa_en.

Display PDFs in Line Weights view
The Line Weights view displays lines with the weights defined in the PDF. When Line Weights view is off, it applies a
constant stroke width (1 pixel) to lines, regardless of zoom. When you print the document, the stroke prints at the true
width.
Choose View &amp;gt; Show/Hide &amp;gt; Rulers &amp; Grids &amp;gt; Line Weights. To turn off Line Weights view, choose View &amp;gt; Show/Hide
&amp;gt; Rulers &amp; Grids &amp;gt; Line Weights again.
Note: You cannot turn off Line Weights view when viewing PDFs within a web browser.

Compare a revised PDF to an earlier version (Acrobat Pro DC)
Use the Compare Documents feature to show the differences between two versions of a PDF. You can customize many
options for displaying the compare results.
1 Choose View &amp;gt; Compare Documents.
2 Specify the two documents to compare. If one or both of the documents is in a PDF Portfolio, select the PDF

Portfolio. Under Package Item, select the component PDF.
3 As needed, specify the page ranges in the documents to compare in the First Page and Last Page boxes.
4 Select the Document Description that best describes the documents you are comparing, and click OK.

Once the two documents are analyzed, a results document appears with the Compare panel open. The new
document is shown with annotations indicating the changes. The first page shows a summary of the comparison
results.
5 From the Compare panel, do any of the following:

• To hide the annotations that display changes, click Hide Results.
• To specify the display options for compare results, click Show Options. You can specify the type of changes to
display, and the color scheme and opacity of the annotations. To return to the page thumbnails, click Hide

Document Description options
Reports, Spreadsheets, Magazine Layouts Compares the content as one continuous text body, from end to end.
Presentation Decks, Drawings Or Illustrations Looks at each slide or page as a mini-document, and matches ones that

are similar. Then compares the content of each matching document. Identifies documents that have moved, such as
slides in presentation.
Scanned Documents Creates an image capture of each scanned page and compares pixels. Looks at each scanned page
and matches ones that are similar. Also identifies pages that are in a different order. This option is useful for comparing
images or architectural drawings.
Compare Text Only Use this option with any document type. This option is designed for comparing text in large

documents (250 pages or more). This option also compares text between documents that have background artwork on
each page, which slows processing.

• With either the reports or presentation options selected, the Compare Text Only option identifies only the text
differences between two documents.
• With Scanned Documents selected, the text is compared separately from the graphics, and then the results are
combined. In documents containing magazine advertisements that have text on top of background image art, a
reflowed passage is compared in text-only mode. The artwork is compared separately in the background. The
differences (both text and line art and images) are combined into a single results document.

Preferences for viewing PDFs
The Preferences dialog box defines a default page layout and customizes your application in many other ways. For
viewing PDFs, examine the preferences options for Documents, General, Page Display, and 3D &amp; Multimedia.

on the left side of the work area opens the navigation
pane to the Page Thumbnails panel, which displays thumbnail images of each page. Click a page thumbnail to open
that page in the document pane.

Page through a document
There are many ways to turn pages in a PDF. Many people use the buttons on the Page Navigation toolbar, but you can
also use arrow keys, scroll bars, and other features to move forward and backward through a multipage PDF.
The Page Navigation toolbar opens by default. The default toolbar contains frequently used tools: the Show Next Page ,
Show Previous Page , and Page Number. Like all toolbars, the Page Navigation toolbar can be hidden and reopened by
choosing it in the Toolbars menu under the View menu. You can display additional tools on the Page Navigation
toolbar by right-clicking the toolbar and choosing an individual tool, Show All Tools, or More Tools and then
selecting and deselecting tools in the dialog box.

Move through a PDF

Note: If the document page numbers are different from the actual page position in the PDF file, the page’s position within
the file appears in parentheses after the assigned page number in the Page Navigation toolbar. For example, if you assign
numbering for a file that is an 18-page chapter to begin with page 223, the number shown when the first page is active
is 223 (1 of 18). You can turn off logical page numbers in the Page Display preferences. See Renumber pages and
Preferences for viewing PDFs.

Jump to bookmarked pages
Bookmarks provide a table of contents and usually represent the chapters and sections in a document. Bookmarks
appear in the navigation pane.

Automatically scroll through a document
Automatic scrolling advances your view of the PDF at a steady rate, moving vertically down the document. If you
interrupt the process by using the scroll bars to move back or forward to another page or position, automatic scrolling
continues from that point forward. At the end of the PDF, automatic scrolling stops and does not begin again until you
choose automatic scrolling again.
1 Choose View &amp;gt; Page Display &amp;gt; Automatically Scroll.
2 Press Esc to stop scrolling.

Retrace your viewing path
You can find PDF pages that you viewed earlier by retracing your viewing path. It’s helpful to understand the difference
between previous and next pages and previous and next views. In the case of pages, previous and next refer to the two
adjacent pages, before and after the currently active page. In the case of views, previous and next refer to your viewing
history. For example, if you jump forward and backward in a document, your viewing history retraces those steps,
showing you the pages you viewed in the reverse order that you viewed them.
1 Choose View &amp;gt; Page Navigation &amp;gt; Previous View .
2 To continue seeing another part of your path, do either of the following:

• Repeat step 1.
• Choose View &amp;gt; Page Navigation &amp;gt; Next View .
Note: You can make the Previous View button and Next View button available in the
toolbar area by right-clicking the Page Navigation toolbar and choosing them on the context menu, or choosing Show
All Tools.

Navigate with links
Links can take you to another location in the current document, to other PDF documents, or to websites. Clicking a
link can also open file attachments and play 3D content, movies, and sound clips. To play these media clips, you must
have the appropriate hardware and software installed.
The person who created the PDF document determines what links look like in the PDF.
Note: Unless a link was created in Acrobat using the Link tool, you must have the Create Links From URLs option selected
in the General preferences for a link to work correctly.
1 Choose the Select tool.
2 Position the pointer over the linked area on the page until the pointer changes to the hand with a pointing finger. A

plus sign (+) or a w appears within the hand if the link points to the web. Then click the link.

PDFs with file attachments
If you open a PDF that has one or more attached files, the Attachments panel automatically opens, listing the attached
files. You can open these files for viewing, edit the attachments, and save your changes, as permitted by the document
authors.
If you move the PDF to a new location, the attachments automatically move with it.

Article threads
In PDFs, articles are optional electronic threads that the PDF author may define within that PDF. Articles lead readers
through the PDF content, jumping over pages or areas of the page that are not included in the article, in the same way
that you might skim through a traditional newspaper or magazine, following one specific story and ignoring the rest.
When you read an article, the page view may zoom in or out so that the current part of the article fills the screen.

Open and navigate an article thread
1 Click the Hand tool on the Common Tools toolbar.

Choose View &amp;gt; Show/Hide &amp;gt; Navigation Panes &amp;gt; Articles to open the Articles panel.
Note: You cannot open the Articles panel if you are viewing the PDF inside a web browser. You must open the PDF in
Acrobat.
2 Double-click the Article icon to go to the beginning of that article. The icon changes to the Follow Article pointer

• To scroll backward through the article one pane at a time, Shift-click in the article, or press Shift+Enter.
• To go to the beginning of the article, Ctrl-click within the article.
4 At the end of the article, click in the article again.

The previous page view is restored, and the pointer changes to the End Article pointer

To see keyboard shortcuts for resizing the document, open the View &amp;gt; Zoom menu.

Show a page at actual size
Choose View &amp;gt; Zoom &amp;gt; Actual Size.
The actual size for a PDF page is typically 100%, but the document may have been set to another magnification level
when it was created.

Change the magnification with zoom tools
Do one of the following:

• Click the Zoom In button

or the Zoom Out button

in the toolbar.

• Enter a magnification percentage in the Common Tools toolbar, either by typing or choosing from the pop-up
menu.
• Drag the Marquee Zoom tool to define the area of the page that you want to fill the document pane.
(View &amp;gt; Zoom &amp;gt; Marquee Zoom)
• Drag the Continuous Zoom tool (also called Dynamic Zoom)
up to increase the magnification and
down to decrease magnification. (View &amp;gt; Show/Hide &amp;gt; Toolbar Items &amp;gt; Select &amp; Zoom &amp;gt; Dynamic Zoom)
When the Marquee Zoom tool is selected, you can Ctrl-click or Ctrl-drag to zoom out. Holding down Shift switches
temporarily from the Marquee Zoom tool to the Dynamic Zoom tool.

Change the magnification with the Pan &amp; Zoom Window tool
1 Choose View &amp;gt; Zoom &amp;gt; Pan &amp; Zoom, or click the Pan &amp; Zoom tool in the Select and Zoom toolbar.
2 Do any of the following:

• Drag the handles of the box in the Pan &amp; Zoom window to change the document magnification.
• Drag the center of the box to pan across the area you want to see.
• Click the navigation buttons to move to a different page.
• Enter a value in the zoom text box, or click the plus or minus buttons to increase or
decrease the magnification by preset levels.

Change the magnification with the Loupe tool
Choose View &amp;gt; Zoom&amp;gt; Loupe Tool.
1 Click the area of the document you want to view in closer detail. A rectangle appears in the document,

corresponding to the area shown in the Loupe Tool window. You can drag or resize the rectangle to change the
Loupe tool view.

You can change the color of the Loupe tool rectangle. Click the Line Color pop-up menu in the lower-right corner of
the Loupe Tool window, and select a new color.

Change the magnification by using a page thumbnail
1 Click the Page Thumbnails button

in the navigation pane on the left side of the window.

2 Locate the thumbnail for the page. Then position the pointer over the lower-right corner of the page-view box until

the pointer changes into a double-headed arrow.
3 Drag the corner of the box to reduce or expand the view of the page.
4 As needed, move the pointer over the zoom box frame within the thumbnail until it changes into a Hand icon. Then

drag the frame to see a different area of the page in the document pane.

Change the default magnification

Display off-screen areas of a magnified page
When you zoom in to a high magnification, you may be able to see only part of a page. You can shift the view to show
other areas of the page without changing the magnification level.
Do either of the following:

• Use the vertical scroll bars to move up and down the pages or the horizontal scroll bars to move across the page.
• Select the Hand tool in the Common Tools toolbar and drag to move the page, as if moving a piece of paper on
a table.

Set the page layout and orientation
Changing the page layout is especially useful when you want to zoom out to get an overview of the document layout.
Choose View &amp;gt; Page Display, and select any of the following page layouts:
Single Page View Displays one page at a time, with no portion on other pages visible.
Enable Scrolling Displays pages in a continuous vertical column that is one page wide.
Two Page View Displays each two-page spread with no portion of other pages visible.
Two Page Scrolling Displays facing pages side by side in a continuous vertical column.

If a document has more than two pages, you can ensure that the first page appears alone on the right side of the
document pane. Select either Two Page View or Two Page Scrolling. Also select View &amp;gt; Page Display &amp;gt; Show Cover Page
In Two Page View.

You can also display buttons for each of these options in the Quick Tools toolbar by choosing View &amp;gt; &amp;gt; Show/Hide &amp;gt;
Toolbar Items &amp;gt; Page Display, and selecting them in the menu.
Note: In Single Page View, choosing Edit &amp;gt; Select All selects all text on the current page. In other layouts, Select All selects
all text in the PDF.

Rotate the page view
You can change the view of a page in 90-degree increments. This changes the view of the page, not its actual orientation.

• To temporarily rotate the page view, choose View &amp;gt; Rotate View &amp;gt; Clockwise or Counterclockwise. You can’t save
this change.
• To save the rotation with the document, choose Tools &amp;gt; Organize Pages &amp;gt; Rotate Clockwise button
Rotate Counterclockwisethe button
in the toolbar.

Change the default page layout (initial view)
You specify the default initial view settings in the Preferences dialog box. (See Set preferences.)
1 In the Preferences dialog box under Categories, select Page Display.

2 Open the Page Layout menu and choose Automatic, Single Page, Single Page Continuous, Two-Up, or Two-Up

Continuous.
Note: The PDF opens with the page layout specified in Preferences unless a different page layout is specified in Document
Properties (File &amp;gt; Properties &amp;gt; Initial View). The Document Properties setting overrides the Preferences setting. If using
Document Properties, be sure to save and close the document for the change to take effect. Acrobat users can change the
initial view, unless security settings prevent changes. Reader users cannot change the initial view.

Use split-window view
You can view a PDF with the document pane divided into two panes (Split command) or four panes (Spreadsheet Split
command).
With Split view, you can scroll, change the magnification level, or turn to a different page in the active pane without
affecting the other pane.
The Spreadsheet Split view is useful if you want to keep column headings and row labels visible while scrolling through
a large spreadsheet or table. In this mode, changing the magnification in one pane changes the magnification in all
panes. Also, scrolling is coordinated between the panes. Scrolling a pane horizontally also scrolls the pane above or
below it. Scrolling vertically also scrolls the pane to the left or right of that pane.
1 Start creating the type of split view you want:

• To split the view into two panes, choose Window &amp;gt; Split, or drag the gray box above the vertical scroll bar.
• To split the view into four panes with synchronized scrolling and zoom levels, choose Window &amp;gt; Spreadsheet
Split.
2 Drag the splitter bars up, down, left, or right to resize the panes, as needed.
3 Adjust the zoom level, as needed:

• In Split view, click a pane to make it active, and change the zoom level for that pane only.
• In Spreadsheet Split view, adjust the zoom level to change the displays in all four panes.
4 Scroll, as needed:

• In Split view, click a pane to make it active, and scroll to change that pane only.
• In Spreadsheet Split view, click a pane, and scroll vertically to change the views in the active pane and the pane
beside it. Scroll horizontally to change the views in the active pane and the pane above or below it.
5 To restore single-pane view, choose Window &amp;gt; Remove Split.

View a document in multiple windows
You can create multiple windows for the same document using the New Window command. New windows have the
same size, magnification, and layout as the original window and open at the same page and on top of the original
window. When you open a new window, Acrobat adds the suffix 1 to the original filename and assigns the suffix 2 to
the new window. You can open multiple windows with the suffix incrementing with each new window. Closing a
window causes the remaining open windows to be renumbered sequentially; that is, if you have five windows open
and you close the third window that you opened, the windows are renumbered with the suffixes 1 to 4.
Note: This feature is not available when PDFs are viewed in a browser.

Measure the height, width, or area of objects
Use the measuring tools to measure distances and areas of objects in PDF documents. The measuring tools are
useful for showing the distances and areas associated with objects in a form or computer-aided design (CAD)
drawing. You can also use these tools to measure certain areas of a document before sending it to a professional
printer. The measuring tools are available to Acrobat Reader DC users only if the PDF creator enables measuring
functionality.
When you use a measuring tool, the Measurement Info panel shows information about the measurement, such as
current measurement, delta values, and scale ratio. Acrobat DC inserts comments with the values calculated for
distance, perimeter, or area.

Flash Player needed | Acrobat DC, Acrobat Reader DC
Why an alert about Flash Player?
You need Flash Player to view Flash content in PDFs, PDF Portfolios, and other features. Adobe Reader and Acrobat
no longer include Flash Player, and features that require Flash now leverage the machine’s local copy of Flash. This new
strategy allows users and administrators to manage Flash Player updates independently of Acrobat product updates.
Note that the Flash Active X component is not enough to display Flash content. A full Flash Player must be installed.

Flash Player installs for end users
1 Right-click and download the Flash Player Installer for Windows (Active X and Plugin) or the Flash Player Installer

for Mac OS.

Updating Acrobat DC and using Adobe Digital Editions
Updating Acrobat DC
Acrobat DC application files and components can be updated in a variety of ways. Some updates are available when you
open a PDF that triggers the updating process automatically. For example, if you open a form that uses Asian-language
fonts, you are asked whether you want to download the fonts. Other updates are available only from the Help menu,
and must be installed manually. Some updates are available both automatically and manually.

Manually update the software
Choose Help &amp;gt; Check For Updates, and follow any onscreen instructions.

Change updating preferences
1 Choose Edit &amp;gt; Preferences (Windows) or Acrobat DC/Adobe Acrobat Reader DC &amp;gt; Preferences (Mac OS).
2 From the Categories on the left, select Updater.
3 In the Check For Updates section, select one of the following options for installing updates:
Automatically install updates (recommended) (Windows) Acrobat regularly checks for important updates,

downloads them, and installs them automatically. When finished, you are alerted via a small message in the system
tray that your software has been updated. This method is the best way to keep Acrobat up-to-date and more secure.

Automatically download updates, but let me choose when to install them Acrobat regularly checks for important

updates and downloads them. Acrobat prompts you to start the installation.
Notify me, but let me choose when to download and install updates Acrobat regularly checks for important

updates and notifies you. You can choose to download and install the updates at your convenience.
Do not download or install updates Acrobat doesn't check for updates. Instead, you check for updates yourself

(Help &amp;gt; Check For Updates). This option is the least secure and recommended only for organizations that deploy
updates using other methods.

Manage security settings
If your organization uses server-based security policies, you can set up Acrobat to regularly check for updates to these
policies. Server-based security is set up by an administrator who provides the URL from which to get security updates.
1 In the Preferences dialog box under Categories, select Security.
2 In the Security Settings, select Load Security Settings From A Server.
3 Type the server address in the URL field.
4 Select how often you want to check for security updates.
5 Select Ask Before Installing to receive notification before the server is checked for policy updates.

Adobe Digital Editions
Use the free Adobe® Digital Editions software to read and organize eBooks and other publications.Adobe Digital
Editions is a separate web-based rich Internet application (RIA) that replaces the eBooks features in previous versions
of Acrobat.
When you install Adobe Digital Editions, your existing bookshelf items are automatically imported and available
within the new Adobe Digital Editions bookshelf experience. You can also manually import individual PDFs into your
Adobe Digital Editions bookshelf.
Note: When you open an eBook for the first time, the Adobe Digital Editions software is automatically installed on your
computer.
For more information about Adobe Digital Editions and to download the software, see
www.adobe.com/go/learn_acr_digital_en.

Opening PDFs
You can open a PDF in many ways: from within the Acrobat DC application, from your email application, from your
file system, or on a network from within a web browser.
Note: The Organizer and Organizer-related commands are not available in Acrobat X and later.

Open a PDF in the application
Start Acrobat DC and do one of the following:

• Open a file from the Home &amp;gt; Recent view.
• Choose File &amp;gt; Open. In the Open dialog box, select one or more filenames, and click Open. PDF documents
usually have the extension .pdf.

Last updated 5/10/2016

65
Workspace

If more than one document is open, you can switch between documents by choosing the document name from the
Window menu.

Open a PDF from the desktop or within another application
Do one of the following:

• To open a PDF attached to an email message, open the message and double-click the PDF icon.
• To open a PDF linked to an open web page, click the PDF file link. The PDF usually opens in the web browser.
• Double-click the PDF file icon in your file system.
Note: In Mac OS, you sometimes cannot open a PDF created in Windows by double-clicking the icon. Instead, choose
File &amp;gt; Open With &amp;gt; Acrobat &amp;gt; DC.

Open a PDF in a web browser
When PDFs open in a web page, they open in Read mode. Read mode displays the PDF without the menus, panes, or
toolbars visible. Near the bottom of the window, a floating toolbar appears with basic functionality for viewing
document.

• To show the toolbar, roll your cursor near the bottom of the window.
• To page through the PDF, use the navigation buttons in the toolbar.
• To close Read mode and display the work area, click the Acrobat icon

in the toolbar.

• To disable Read mode within the browser, open the Acrobat or Reader Preferences (in Windows, choose Edit &amp;gt;
Preferences, in Mac OS, choose Acrobat DC/ Acrobat Reader DC &amp;gt; Preferences). Select Internet from the left pane.
Deselect Display In Read Mode By Default.
Note: If you have more than one Adobe PDF application on your computer, you can specify which one is used to open PDFs.
See the Select Default PDF Handler in General preferences.

About viewing PDFs in a web browser
Options in the web browser control how you view a PDF, either within the browser or directly in Acrobat or Reader. To
change the current display behavior, see the browser documentation on managing add-ons or plug-ins. If you open
PDFs in Acrobat outside the browser, you cannot use the preference Allow Fast Web View in a browser.
Because keyboard commands can be mapped to the web browser, some Acrobat shortcuts cannot be available.
Similarly, you may need to use the tools and commands in the Acrobat toolbar rather than the browser toolbar or menu
bar. For example, to print a PDF document, use the Print button in the Acrobat toolbar rather than the Print command
in the browser. (In Microsoft Internet Explorer, you can choose File &amp;gt; Print, Edit &amp;gt; Copy, and Edit &amp;gt; Find On This Page
on the Internet Explorer toolbar.)
Note: Having multiple versions of Acrobat or Adobe Reader installed on the same computer is not recommended. Mixed
versions on your system can prevent you from viewing PDFs in a web browser. Examples include Acrobat XI with Adobe
Reader X, or Acrobat 9 with Reader XI, and so on. For more information about coexisting installations, see this TechNote.

Internet preferences
Display In Read Mode By Default Select to display PDFs in the browser without the menus, panes, or toolbars visible.

Asian, Cyrillic, and right-to-left text in PDFs
Asian language PDFs
You can use Acrobat to view, search, and print PDF documents that contain Asian text (Traditional and Simplified
Chinese, Japanese, and Korean). You can also use these languages when you fill in forms, add comments, and apply
digital signatures.
Almost all of the Acrobat features are supported for Traditional and Simplified Chinese, Japanese, and Korean text if
you install the respective Asian language font packs.
In Acrobat in Windows, you must install the Asian language support files by using the custom installation and selecting
the Asian Language Support options under Create Adobe PDF and View Adobe PDF.
PDFMaker and the Adobe PDF printer automatically embed most Asian fonts in your file when creating PDF files. You
can control whether Asian fonts are embedded.
In Windows, you may be able to view and print files that contain Asian languages without having the necessary Asian
language support installed on your system. If you try to open a PDF file for which language support is required, you are
automatically prompted to install the required fonts.

Cyrillic, Central European, and Eastern European language PDFs
You can work with Adobe PDF files that contain Cyrillic text (including Bulgarian and Russian), Central European text,
and Eastern European text (including Czech, Hungarian, and Polish) if the fonts are embedded in the PDF files. If the
fonts are embedded, you can view and print the files on any system. Fonts do not need to be embedded to use the Search
feature.
Note: If you open a PDF file in which form fields or text boxes contain these languages but the fonts are not embedded and
are not installed on your system, choosing Help &amp;gt; Check For Updates Now automatically prompts you to download and
install the necessary fonts.

Hebrew, Arabic, Thai, and Vietnamese language PDFs
Acrobat supports the entry and display of Thai and Vietnamese text. In Windows only, Arabic and Hebrew are also
supported. By default, Right-To-Left Language Options is enabled under Arabic and Hebrew regional settings (in
Windows).

Chapter 3: Creating PDFs

Create PDFs with Acrobat DC
There are various ways to create a PDF file using Acrobat DC. Generate a PDF quickly by using menu commands,
dragging-and-dropping files onto the Acrobat DC application icon, or converting clipboard data.
This document provides instructions for Acrobat DC. If you're using Acrobat Reader DC, see What can I do with
Acrobat Reader DC. if you're using Acrobat XI, see Acrobat XI Help .

Convert a file to PDF using Acrobat DC menu commands
1 On the Acrobat DC File menu, choose Create &amp;gt; PDF From File.
2 In the Open dialog box, select the file that you want to convert. You can browse all file types or select a specific type

from the Files Of Type drop-down menu.

3 Optionally, click Settings to change the conversion options if you're converting an image file to PDF. The options

available vary depending on the file type.
Note: The Settings button is unavailable if you choose All Files as the file type or if no conversion settings are available
for the selected file type. (For example, the Settings button is unavailable for Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel files.)
4 Click Open to convert the file to a PDF.

Last updated 5/10/2016

83
Creating PDFs

Depending on the type of file being converted, the authoring application opens automatically, or a progress dialog
box appears. If the file is in an unsupported format, a message appears, telling you that the file cannot be converted
to PDF.
5 When the new PDF opens, choose File &amp;gt; Save or File &amp;gt; Save As; then select a name and location for the PDF.

When naming a PDF that’s intended for electronic distribution, limit the filename to eight characters (with no spaces)
and include the .pdf extension. This action ensures that email programs or network servers don’t truncate the filename
and that the PDF opens as expected.

Drag-and-drop to create PDFs
This method is best reserved for small, simple files, such as small image files and plain text files, when the balance
between file size and output quality is not important. You can use this technique with many other types of files, but you
cannot adjust any conversion settings during the process.
1 Select the icons of one or more files in the Windows Explorer or Mac OS Finder.
2 Drag the file icons onto the Acrobat DC application icon. Or (Windows only) drag the files into the open Acrobat

DC window.
If a message appears saying that the file could not be opened in Acrobat DC, then that file type cannot be converted
to PDF by the drag-and-drop method. Use one of the other conversion methods for that file.
Note: You can also convert PostScript and EPS files to PDF by dragging them onto the Acrobat DC window or the
Acrobat DC application icon.
3 Save the PDF.

(Windows only) You can also right-click a file in Windows Explorer and choose Convert to Adobe PDF.

Convert clipboard content to PDF
You can create PDFs from text and images that you copy from applications on Mac OS or Windows.
1 Capture content in the Clipboard:

• Use the copy command in the applications.
• Press the PrintScreen key (Windows).
• Use the Grab utility (Applications &amp;gt; Utilities &amp;gt; Grab), and choose Edit &amp;gt; Copy to place the content on the
clipboard. (Mac OS)
• In a PDF file, you can select objects using the Edit Object tool (Tools &amp;gt; Print Production &amp;gt; Edit Object), and
then copy the selected objects.

Creating PDFs

This process can be useful for creating a one-page PDF. For longer, more complex, or heavily formatted documents, it’s
better to create the source document in an application that offers more layout and formatting options, such as Adobe
InDesign or Microsoft Word.
1 In Adobe Acrobat DC, close all open documents.
2 Choose Tools &amp;gt; Create PDF &amp;gt; Blank Page &amp;gt; Create.

A blank single-page PDF is created.
To add a blank page to an existing PDF, open the PDF and then choose Tools &amp;gt; Organize Pages &amp;gt; Insert &amp;gt; Blank Page.

Create multiple PDFs from multiple files (Acrobat Pro DC)
You can create multiple PDFs from multiple native files, including files of different supported formats, in one operation.
This method is useful when you must convert a large number of files to PDF.
Note: When you use this method, Acrobat DC applies the most recently used conversion settings without offering you access
to those settings. If you want to adjust the conversion settings, do so before using this method.
1 Choose File &amp;gt; Create &amp;gt; Create Multiple PDF Files.
2 Choose Add Files &amp;gt; Add Files or Add Folders, and then select the files or folder.

3 Click OK. The Output options dialog box appears.
4 In the Output Options dialog box, specify your target folder and filename preferences, and then click OK.

Creating PDFs with PDFMaker

Create PDFs with PDFMaker (Windows)
About Acrobat PDFMaker
PDFMaker is an Acrobat feature that operates within many business applications, such as Microsoft Office applications,
AutoCAD, and Lotus Notes. When you install Acrobat, PDFMaker controls appear in the work area of the authoring
application.
Note: Some PDFMaker features are not available in certain versions of the authoring applications. For a comparison chart,
see Compatible web browsers and PDFMaker applications | Acrobat, Reader.
Using PDFMaker within an authoring application is a simple, one-click procedure. It involves clicking an Acrobat
PDFMaker toolbar button or choosing a command on the Adobe PDF menu. It is not necessary to open Acrobat.

Convert a file to PDF using PDFMaker
In Windows, Acrobat installs both an Acrobat PDFMaker toolbar and an Adobe PDF menu in many popular authoring
applications. You can use either the toolbar buttons or the Adobe PDF menu (the Action menu in Lotus Notes) to create
PDFs, but the menu also provides access to conversion settings. Although many of the conversion options are common
to all authoring applications, a few are application-specific.
For Microsoft Office 2007 and later applications such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, the options for creating PDFs
are available from the Acrobat ribbon.
Note: If you don’t see the PDF toolbar buttons in an application, you must show or activate the PDF toolbar. For other
troubleshooting issues, see Troubleshoot Acrobat PDFMaker Problems.

Show or activate PDFMaker in Microsoft Office and Lotus Notes
If the PDF toolbar buttons don’t appear in your Microsoft Office or Lotus Notes application, use one of the following
methods to show or activate PDFMaker.
For Lotus Notes 8 or later, choose File &amp;gt; Preferences. In the dialog box that appears, choose Toolbar &amp;gt; Toolbars, and
select the Visible option for Acrobat PDFMaker.
For Office 2007 or Office 2010, follow these steps:
1 Do one of the following:

• (Outlook 2007) Choose Tools &amp;gt; Trust Center.
• (Other Office 2007 applications) Click the Office button, and then click the [Application] Options button, where
[Application] is the Office application name. For example, in Word, the button name is Word Options.
• (Office 2010 applications) Click the File tab, and then click Option.
2 Click Add-Ins on the left side of the dialog box.

Convert email messages to PDFs
You can use PDFMaker to convert one or more Microsoft Outlook or Lotus Notes email messages or entire folders of
messages to a merged PDF or PDF Portfolio. Within a PDF Portfolio, each email message appears as a separate PDF file.
The Acrobat PDFMaker Conversion Settings dialog box contains the option that determines whether email messages
are merged into one continuous PDF or assembled into a PDF Portfolio.
The controls that activate an email conversion to PDF appear in two places within the email application: on the Acrobat
PDFMaker toolbar and on a menu. In Outlook, the menu is called Adobe PDF and appears to the right of the Outlook
Help menu. In Lotus Notes, PDF commands appear under the Actions menu.
You can convert one currently open email message to PDF (not to a PDF Portfolio) by choosing File &amp;gt; Print, and
selecting Adobe PDF as the printer in the Print dialog box. The PDFMaker conversion settings do not affect this process.

Specify whether email messages become merged PDFs or PDF Portfolios

Create PDFs from Word mail merges
Mail merges from Word generate documents like form letters—for one common example—that are personalized with
information like the names and addresses of the recipients. With Acrobat PDFMaker, you can save steps by using a
Word mail merge document and corresponding data file to output mail merges directly to PDF. You can even set up
PDFMaker to attach those PDFs to email messages that are generated during the PDF-creation process.

Convert Visio files to PDF (Acrobat Pro)
PDFs created from Visio files preserve page sizes and support layers, searchable text, custom properties, links,
bookmarks, and comments, depending on the conversion settings. To specify the properties

<!-- 89aeca71-0b93-4e9c-bb7a-d79e7afae400 <=< ACCEPT -->• (Visio 2007) Choose Adobe PDF &amp;gt; Change Conversion Settings to review these settings, if needed.<!-- ACCEPT >=> 89aeca71-0b93-4e9c-bb7a-d79e7afae400 -->
• (Visio 2010) From the ribbon choose Acrobat &amp;gt; Preferences
When you convert your Visio file, only shapes and guides that are printable and visible in the Visio drawing are
converted and appear in the PDF. Shapes are converted regardless of their protection or behavior. Shape custom
properties can be converted to PDF object data.
When you convert the Visio file to a PDF, you can preserve all or just some layers, or you can flatten all layers. If you
flatten layers, the PDF will look like the original drawing, but won’t contain any layer information. When flattened, the
contents of only visible and printable layers will appear in the converted PDF.

Select Visio layers to convert (Acrobat Pro)
You can convert a Visio drawing that contains layers to a PDF and retain some or all of the layers in the resulting PDF,
or you can flatten the layers. You can also organize the Visio layers in layer sets, which are folders in the Acrobat Layers
panel.
1 With the multilayered file open in Visio, click a button in the Adobe PDF toolbar, and select Retain Some Layers In

The Selected Page.
Note: If the Retain Some Layers In The Selected Page option is not available, deselect the Convert All Pages In Drawing
option.
2 Select one or more layers in the Layers In Visio Drawing list.
3 To add the selected Visio layers to the list of layers to convert to the PDF file, do one of the following:

• To convert the selected Visio layers to individual PDF layers within a PDF layer set, click Create Layer Set, and
optionally, type a layer name.
• To convert the selected Visio layers to individual layers (but not grouped under a layer set), click the Add Layer(s)
button.
Note: The name of a layer in the Layers In Visio Drawing list is unavailable if that layer is included in the Layers In
PDF list. When you select that layer in the Layers In PDF list, a bullet appears next to the layer’s name in the Layers In
Visio Drawing list.
4 Optionally, do any of the following:

• To reorder the layers in the Layers In PDF list, drag an item up or down in the list.
• To include a visibility property that can be switched on or off in Acrobat, deselect Locked On adjacent to the PDF
layer; to lock the resulting PDF layer’s visibility on, select Locked On.
• To save the current settings of Visio layers selected, click Save PDF Settings, and click OK. These settings are used
the next time you convert the current Visio file to a PDF file.
5 Click Convert To PDF, specify a folder in the Save In box in which to save the PDF file, type a filename, and then

click Save.
Note: Visio layers that were selected for conversion and that have Visio settings for visible, printable, or lock are
converted to PDF layers; the visible and printable properties are included in the resulting PDF layers. If the Visio file
contains a background page, header, or footer, the PDF file automatically has PDF layers named for those items.

Convert AutoCAD files to PDF (Acrobat Pro for Windows)
Use PDFMaker to convert AutoCAD files from within the AutoCAD application. You can also use the Batch
Conversion feature to convert many AutoCAD files in one operation. Even if you don’t have AutoCAD, you can convert
AutoCAD files to PDF from Acrobat.
Acrobat PDFMaker allows you to preserve selected layers and layouts when converting AutoCAD files to PDF.

Convert AutoCAD files when AutoCAD is not installed
The default Acrobat installation installs Autodesk filters. These filters allow you to convert files in DWG, DWF, DST,
DWT, and DXF format into PDF, without the native application installed.
1 In Acrobat, choose File &amp;gt; Create &amp;gt; PDF From File.

Print to PDF
Instead of a physical printer, you can select Adobe PDF in almost any Windows or Mac OS application. Print to PDF
creates an electronic copy of your file that you can save to disk.
When you use Acrobat DC to print a document to PDF, people will see it just like you sent it — whether they're viewing
it on a computer, tablet, or smartphone.

Print to PDF (Windows)
1 Open a file in a Windows application.
2 Choose File &amp;gt; Print.
3 Choose Adobe PDF as the printer in the Print dialog box.
4 Click Print. Type a name for your file, and click Save.

Print to PDF (Mac OS)
1 Open a file in a Mac OS application.
2 Click the PDF button and choose Save As Adobe PDF.

Scan documents to PDF
Scan a paper document to PDF and turn it into a smart, searchable PDF with selectable text.

Scan a paper document to PDF
You can create a PDF file directly from a paper document, using your scanner and Acrobat DC. On Windows, Acrobat
DC supports TWAIN scanner drivers and Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) drivers. On Mac OS, Acrobat DC
supports TWAIN and Image Capture (ICA).
In Windows, you can either use the Autodetect Color Mode and let Acrobat determine the paper document’s content
type, or use other presets (Black &amp; White Document, Grayscale Document, Color Image, and Color Document) based
on your judgment. You can configure the scanning presets or use the Custom Scan option to scan with the settings of
your choice.
Note: Preset scanning is available only for scanner drivers that support Hide Scanner’s Native Interface mode. The scanning
presets are not available on Mac OS.
In Windows, if a WIA driver is installed for your scanner, you can use the Scan button on your scanner to create a PDF.
Press the Scan button, and then in Windows, choose Adobe Acrobat DC from the list of registered applications. Then,
in the Acrobat DC Scan scan interface, select a scanner and a document preset or Custom Scan.

Creating PDFs

Color/Grayscale Scans When scanning color or grayscale pages, select one of the following:
JPEG2000 Applies JPEG2000 compression to the colored image content. (This setting is not recommended when

creating PDF/A files. Use JPEG instead.)
ZIP Applies ZIP compression to the colored image content.
JPEG Applies JPEG compression to the colored image content.

Note: The scanner uses either the selected Color/Grayscale option or the selected Monochrome option. Which one is used
depends on the settings you select in the Acrobat Scan dialog box or in the scanner’s TWAIN interface, which may open
after you click Scan in the Acrobat Scan dialog box. (By default, the scanner application dialog box does not open.)
Monochrome Scans When scanning black-and-white or monotone images, select one of the following:
JBIG2 (Lossless) &amp; JBIG2(Lossy) Applies the JBIG2 compression method to black-and-white input pages. Highest-

quality levels use the lossless method; at lower settings, text is highly compressed. Text pages typically are 60% smaller
than CCITT Group 4 compressed pages, but processing is slow. Compatible with Acrobat 5.0 (PDF 1.4) and later.
Note: For compatibility with Acrobat 4.0, use a compression method other than JBIG2.
CCITT Group 4 Applies CCITT Group 4 compression to black-and-white input page images. This fast, lossless
compression method is compatible with Acrobat 3.0 (PDF 1.2) and later.
Small Size/High Quality Sets the balance point between file size and quality.
Deskew Rotates any page that is not square with the sides of the scanner bed, to make the PDF page align vertically.
Choose On or Off.
Background Removal Whitens nearly white areas of grayscale and color input (not black-and-white input).

For best results, calibrate your scanner’s contrast and brightness settings so that a scan of a normal black-and-white page
has dark gray or black text and a white background. Then, Off or Low should produce good results. If scanning off-white
paper or newsprint, use Medium or High to clean up the page.
Descreen Removes halftone dot structure, which can reduce JPEG compression, cause moire patterns, and make text
difficult to recognize. Suitable for 200–400-dpi grayscale or RGB input or, for Adaptive Compression, 400–600-dpi
black-and-white input. The On setting (recommended) applies the filter for 300 dpi or higher grayscale and RGB input.
Select Off when scanning a page with no pictures or filled areas, or when scanning at a resolution higher than the
effective range.
Text Sharpening Sharpens the text of the scanned PDF file. The default value is low and suitable for most documents.

Increase it if the quality of the printed document is low and the text is unclear.

Scanning tips
• Acrobat scanning accepts images between 10 dpi and 3000 dpi. If you select Searchable Image or ClearScan for PDF
Output Style, input resolution of 72 dpi or higher is required. Also, input resolution higher than 600 dpi is
downsampled to 600 dpi or lower.

Last updated 5/10/2016

105
Creating PDFs

• To apply lossless compression to a scanned image, select one of these options under the Optimization Options in
the Optimize Scanned PDF dialog box: CCITT Group 4 for monochrome images, or Lossless for color or grayscale
images. If this image is appended to a PDF document, and you save the file using the Save option, the scanned image
remains uncompressed. If you save the PDF using Save As, the scanned image may be compressed.
• For most pages, black-and-white scanning at 300 dpi produces text best suited for conversion. At 150 dpi, OCR
accuracy is slightly lower, and more font-recognition errors occur; at 400 dpi and higher resolution, processing
slows, and compressed pages are bigger. If a page has many unrecognized words or small text (9 points or smaller),
try scanning at higher resolution. Scan in black and white whenever possible.
• When Recognize Text Using OCR is disabled, full 10-to-3000 dpi resolution range may be used, but the
recommended resolution is 72 and higher dpi. For Adaptive Compression, 300 dpi is recommended for grayscale or
RGB input, or 600 dpi for black-and-white input.
• Pages scanned in 24-bit color, 300 dpi, at 8-1/2–by-11 in. (21.59-by-27.94 cm) result in large images (25 MB) before
compression. Your system may require 50 MB of virtual memory or more to scan the image. At 600 dpi, both
scanning and processing typically are about four times slower than at 300 dpi.
• Avoid dithering or halftone scanner settings. These settings can improve the appearance of photographs, but they
make it difficult to recognize text.
• For text printed on colored paper, try increasing the brightness and contrast by about 10%. If your scanner has colorfiltering capability, consider using a filter or lamp that drops out the background color. Or if the text isn’t crisp or
drops out, try adjusting scanner contrast and brightness to clarify the scan.
• If your scanner has a manual brightness control, adjust it so that characters are clean and well formed. If characters
are touching, use a higher (brighter) setting. If characters are separated, use a lower (darker) setting.

Recognize text in scanned documents
You can use Acrobat DC to recognize text in previously scanned documents that have already been converted to PDF.
Optical character recognition (OCR) software enables you to search, correct, and copy the text in a scanned PDF. To
apply OCR to a PDF, the original scanner resolution must have been set at 72 dpi or higher.
Note: Scanning at 300 dpi produces the best text for conversion. At 150 dpi, OCR accuracy is slightly lower.

Recognize text in a single document
1 Open the scanned PDF.
2 Choose Tools &amp;gt; Enhance Scans &amp;gt; Recognize Text &amp;gt; In This File.

The Recognize Text options are displayed in the Secondary toolbar.
3 In the Secondary toolbar, select a page range and language for text recognition.
4 Optionally, click Settings to open the Recognize Text dialog box, and specify the options as needed.
5 Click Recognize Text. Acrobat creates a layer of text in your PDF that can be searched — or copied and pasted into

a new document.

Recognize text in multiple documents
1 Choose Tools &amp;gt; Enhance Scans &amp;gt; Recognize Text &amp;gt; In Multiple Files.
2 In the Recognize Text dialog box, click Add Files, and choose Add Files, Add Folders, or Add Open Files. Then

select the files or folder.
3 In the Output Options dialog box, specify a target folder for output files, and filename preferences.
4 In the Recognize Text - General Settings dialog box, specify the options, and then click OK.

Creating PDFs

Acrobat creates a layer of text in your PDF that can be searched — or copied and pasted into a new document.

Recognize Text - General Settings dialog box
Document Language Specifies the language for the OCR engine to use to identify the characters.
Output (PDF Output Style) Determines the type of PDF to produce. All options require an input resolution of 72 dpi or
higher (recommended). All formats apply OCR and font and page recognition to the text images and convert them to
normal text.
Searchable Image Ensures that text is searchable and selectable. This option keeps the original image, deskews it as
needed, and places an invisible text layer over it. The selection for Downsample Images in this same dialog box
determines whether the image is downsampled and to what extent.
Searchable Image (Exact) Ensures that text is searchable and selectable. This option keeps the original image and places
an invisible text layer over it. Recommended for cases requiring maximum fidelity to the original image.
Editable Text &amp; Images Synthesizes a new custom font that closely approximates the original, and preserves the page
background using a low-resolution copy.
Downsample To Decreases the number of pixels in color, grayscale, and monochrome images after OCR is complete.

Choose the degree of downsampling to apply. Higher-numbered options do less downsampling, producing higherresolution PDFs.

Correct OCR text in PDFs
When you run OCR on a scanned output, Acrobat DC analyzes bitmaps of text and substitutes words and characters
for those bitmap areas. If the ideal substitution is uncertain, Acrobat DC marks the word as suspect. Suspects appear
in the PDF as the original bitmap of the word, but the text is included on an invisible layer behind the bitmap of the
word. This method makes the word searchable even though it is displayed as a bitmap.
Note: If you try to select text in a scanned PDF that does not have OCR applied, or try to perform a Read Out Loud
operation on an image file, Acrobat DC asks if you want to run OCR. If you click OK, the Text Recognition dialog box
opens and you can select options, which are described in detail under the previous topic.
1 Choose Tools &amp;gt; Enhance Scans &amp;gt; Recognize Text &amp;gt; Correct Recognized Text.

Acrobat DC identifies suspected text errors and displays the image and text side by side in the Secondary toolbar.
(All suspect words on the page are enclosed in boxes.)
2 Click the highlighted object or box in the document, and then correct it in the Recognized As box in the Secondary

toolbar. Click Accept.
The next suspect is highlighted. Correct mistakes as needed. Click Accept for each correction.
3 Click Close in the Secondary toolbar when the task is complete.

Creating PDFs

Overview of PDF creation
What’s the best way to create a PDF?
You create a PDF by converting other documents and resources to Portable Document Format. You can usually choose
from several PDF creation methods, depending on the type of file you start with and your requirements for the PDF.
You can create PDFs from documents printed on paper, Microsoft Word documents, InDesign® files, and digital
images, to name just a few examples. Different types of sources have different tools available for PDF conversion. In
many applications, you can create PDFs by selecting the Adobe PDF printer in the Print dialog box.
If a file is open in its authoring application (such as a spreadsheet that is open in Microsoft Excel), you can usually
convert the file to PDF without opening Adobe Acrobat. Similarly, if Acrobat is already open, you don’t have to open
the authoring application to convert a file to PDF.
Every PDF strikes a balance between efficiency (small file size) and quality (such as resolution and color). When that
balance is critical to your task, you’ll want to use a method that includes access to various conversion options.
For example, you can drag files to the Acrobat icon to create PDFs. In this case, Acrobat applies the most recently used
conversion settings without providing access to those settings. If you want more control over the process, you’ll want
to use another method.

Balancing PDF file size and quality
You can select various settings to ensure that your PDF has the best balance between file size, resolution, conformity to
specific standards, and other factors. Which settings you select depends on your goals for the PDF that you are creating.
For example, a PDF intended for high-quality commercial printing requires different settings than a PDF intended only
for onscreen viewing and quick downloading over the Internet.
Once selected, these settings apply across PDFMaker, Acrobat, and Acrobat Distiller. However, some settings are
limited to specific contexts or file types. For example, PDFMaker options can vary among the different types of
Microsoft Office applications.
For convenience, you can select one of the conversion presets available in Acrobat. You can also create, define, save, and
reuse custom presets that are uniquely suited to your purposes.
For scanned documents, you can choose from Autodetect Color Mode or several scanning presets that are optimized
for scanning documents and images in color or black and white. You can modify these presets, or use your own custom
scanning settings.

Using the Adobe PDF printer
Create PDFs by printing to file
In many authoring applications, you can use the Print command with the Adobe PDF printer to convert your file to
PDF. Your source document is converted to PostScript and fed directly to Distiller for conversion to PDF, without
manually starting Distiller. The current Distiller preference settings and Adobe PDF settings are used to convert the
file. If you’re working with nonstandard page sizes, create a custom page size.

Creating PDFs

Note: (Windows) For Microsoft Office documents, the Adobe PDF printer does not include some of the features that are
available from PDFMaker. For example, you cannot create bookmarks and hyperlinks using the Adobe PDF printer. If
you’re creating a PDF from a Microsoft Office document and you want to use these features, use PDFMaker.
The Adobe PDF printer creates untagged PDFs. A tagged structure is required for reflowing content to a handheld
device and is preferable for producing reliable results with a screen reader.

Create a PDF using the Print command (Windows)
1 Open the file in its authoring application, and choose File &amp;gt; Print.
2 Choose Adobe PDF from the printers menu.
3 Click the Properties (or Preferences) button to customize the Adobe PDF printer setting. (In some applications, you

may need to click Setup in the Print dialog box to open the list of printers, and then click Properties or Preferences.)
4 In the Print dialog box, click OK.

Note: Your PDF is saved in the folder specified by the setting of the Adobe PDF Output Folder in the Preferences dialog
box; the default location is My Documents. If you specify Prompt For Adobe PDF Filename, then a Save As dialog opens
when you print.

Create a PDF using the Print command (Mac OS X)
The method for creating PDFs using the Print command changed in Mac OS v10.6 Snow Leopard with Acrobat 9.1 and
later. The following procedure describes the method in both Snow Leopard and earlier versions of Mac OS X.
1 Open the file in its authoring application, and choose File &amp;gt; Print.
2 Choose Save As Adobe PDF from the PDF menu at the bottom of the dialog box.
3 For Adobe PDF Settings, choose one of the default settings, or customize the settings using Distiller. Any custom

settings that you have defined are listed.
For most users, the default Adobe PDF conversion settings are adequate.
4 For After PDF Creation, specify whether to open the PDF.
5 Click Continue.
6 Select a name and location for your PDF, and click Save.

Note: By default, your PDF is saved with the same filename and a .pdf extension.

Adobe PDF printing preferences (Windows)
Printing preferences apply to all applications that use the Adobe PDF printer, unless you change the settings in an
authoring application by using the Page Setup,Document Setup, or Print menu.
Note: The dialog box for setting printing preferences is named Adobe PDFPrinting Preferences, Adobe PDF Printing
Defaults, or Adobe PDFDocument Properties, depending on how you access it.
To access printing preferences:

• Open the Printers window from the Start menu. Right-click the Adobe PDF printer, and choose Printing
Preferences.
• In an authoring application such as Adobe InDesign, choose File &amp;gt; Print. Select Adobe PDF as the printer, and click

Create and use a custom page size
It’s important to distinguish between page size (as defined in the source application’s Document Setup dialog box for
your document) and paper size (the sheet of paper, piece of film, or area of the printing plate you’ll print on). Your page
size might be U.S. Letter (8-1/2-by-11 in. or 21.59-by-27.94 cm), but you might need to print on a larger piece of paper
or film to accommodate any printer’s marks or the bleed area. To ensure that your document prints as expected, set up
your page size in both the source application and the printer.
The list of paper sizes available to Acrobat DC comes from the PPD file (PostScript printers) or from the printer driver
(non-PostScript printers). If the printer and PPD file you’ve chosen for PostScript printing support custom paper sizes,
you see a Custom option in the Paper Size menu. For printers capable of producing very large print areas, Acrobat DC
supports pages as large as 15,000,000 in. (38,100,000 cm) by 15,000,000 in. (38,100,000 cm).

Create a custom page size (Windows)
1 Do one of the following:

• Open Devices and Printers or Printer And Faxes window from the Start menu. Right-click the Adobe PDF
printer, and choose Printing Preferences.
• In an authoring application such as Adobe InDesign, choose File &amp;gt; Print. Select Adobe PDF as the printer, and
click the Properties button. (In some applications, you may need to click Setup in the Print dialog box to open
the list of printers, and then click Properties or Preferences to customize the Adobe PDF settings.)
2 In the Adobe PDF Settings tab, click the Add button next to the Adobe PDF Page Size menu.
3 Specify the name, width, height, and unit of measurement. Click Add/Modify to add the custom page size name to

the Adobe PDF Page Size menu.

Create a custom page size (Mac OS)
1 In an authoring application such as Adobe InDesign, choose File &amp;gt; Page Setup.
2 In the Paper Size pop-up menu, select Manage Custom Sizes.
3 Click the + button.

Converting web pages to PDF
Web pages and PDFs
The core of a web page is a file written in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). Typically, the HTML file includes
associations with other files that either appear on the web page or govern how it looks or works.
When you convert a web page to PDF, the HTML file and all associated files—such as JPEG images, Adobe FLA files,
cascading style sheets, text files, image maps, and forms—are included in the conversion process.
The resulting PDF behaves much like the original web page. For example, the images, links, image maps, and most
media files appear and function normally within the PDF. (Animated GIF files appear as still images, showing the last
frame of the animation.)
Also, the PDF functions like any other PDF. For example, you can navigate through the file by scrolling or using
bookmarks; users can add comments to it; you can add security, form fields, and other features that enhance it.
In preparing to convert web pages to PDF, consider the following factors, which affect how you approach the conversion
process:

• How much do you want to convert?
If you want to convert only selected areas of the currently open web page, use PDFMaker from within Internet
Explorer. If you want to convert several levels or all of a multipage website to PDF, work within Acrobat.

• Do you want to create a new PDF from the web pages or to append the converted pages to an existing PDF?
You can do both in either Acrobat or Internet Explorer, but you choose different buttons or commands to
accomplish these things.

Creating PDFs

Note: To convert Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK) language web pages to PDF on a Roman (Western) system in
Windows, you must have installed the CJK language support files while installing Acrobat. Also, it is preferable to select an
appropriate encoding from the HTML conversion settings.

Convert web pages to PDF in Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, and Firefox
(Windows)
Acrobat installs an Adobe PDF toolbar in Internet Explorer (version 8.0 or later), Google Chrome, and Firefox. Using
the commands on this toolbar, you can convert the currently displayed web page to PDF in various ways. For example,
you can convert the entire web page or selected areas of it. Or, you can create a PDF or append the converted web page
to an existing PDF. The toolbar has additional commands that initiate further actions after conversion, such as
attaching the new PDF to a new email message or printing it.
See the video Creating PDF Files from a Web Browser for additional information.

Convert a web page to PDF
To convert a webpage to PDF, do the following:
1 Go to the web page.

• For Windows, use Internet Explorer, Firefox, or Chrome.
• For Mac, use Firefox.
2 Using the Convert menu on the Adobe PDF toolbar, do one of the following:

• To create a PDF from the currently open web page, choose Convert Web Page To PDF. Then select a location,
type a filename, and click Save.
• To add a PDF of the currently open web page to another PDF, choose Add Web Page To Existing PDF. Then
locate and select the existing PDF, and click Save.
• (Internet Explorer and Firefox only) To create and print a PDF from the currently open web page, choose Print
Web Page. When the conversion is complete and the Print dialog box opens, specify options and click OK.
• (Internet Explorer and Firefox only) To create a PDF from the currently open web page and attach it to a blank
email message, choose Convert Web Page And Email. Then specify a location and filename for the PDF, and
click Save. Type the appropriate information in the email message that opens after the conversion is complete.
• For any of these options, to open the output PDF after conversion, select View Adobe PDF Results.
Note: The Adobe Create PDF icon gets added to the supported browsers when you install Acrobat. If you’re unable to see
the Create PDF icon, do the following:

• In Internet Explorer, choose View &amp;gt; Toolbars &amp;gt; Adobe Acrobat Create PDF Toolbar.
• In Firefox, choose Tools &amp;gt; Add-ons &amp;gt; Extensions, and then enable the Adobe Acrobat - Create PDF extension. (For

Creating PDFs

Note: Some websites have hundreds or even thousands of pages. Converting a large website can make your system slow
and unresponsive, and can even use up available hard drive space and memory, causing a system crash. It’s a good idea
to begin by downloading one level of pages and then go through them to find particular links to download.
4 If Get Only N Level(s) is selected, select one or both of the following options:
Stay On Same Path Downloads only web pages subordinate to the specified URL.
Stay On Same Server Downloads only web pages stored on the same server.

5 Click Settings/Advanced Settings , change the selected options in the Web Page Conversion Settings dialog box as

needed, and click OK.
6 Click Create.

Note: You can view PDF pages while they are downloading; however, you cannot modify a page until the download
process is complete.
You do not need to wait for the conversion to complete before adding more requests. While a conversion is in progress,
you can convert another page to PDF and that gets added to the queue. The number of requests in the queue are
indicated by the Pending Conversions field in the Download Status dialog box.

Add an unlinked web page to an existing PDF
Use this procedure to append pages to a writable PDF. If the original PDF is read-only, the result will be a new PDF
rather than new pages in the existing PDF.
1 Open the existing PDF in Acrobat (the PDF to which you want to append a web page).
2 Choose Tools &amp;gt; Organize Pages &amp;gt; Insert &amp;gt; Insert from Web Page.
3 Enter the URL to the web page you want to append and select options, as described for converting web pages to PDF,

and then click Add.
4 Once the web page is converted to PDF, you see the Insert Page dialog box. Choose exactly where you want to add

this page in the existing PDF, and then click OK.

Add a linked web page to an existing PDF
1 Open the previously converted PDF in Acrobat. If necessary, scroll to the page containing links to the pages you

want to add.
2 Right-click the web link, and choose Append To Document.

Note: After pages have been converted, links to these pages change to internal links, and clicking a link takes you to the
PDF page, rather than to the original HTML page on the web.

Convert a linked web page to a new PDF
1 Open the previously converted PDF in Acrobat. If necessary, scroll to the page containing a web link you want to

convert.
2 Right-click the web link, and choose Open Weblink As New Document.

Create PDF Tags Stores a structure in the PDF that corresponds to the HTML structure of the web pages. This structure

lets you create tagged bookmarks for paragraphs, list elements, and other items that use HTML elements.
Place Headers And Footers On New Page Places a header and footer on every page. Headers show the web page title, or

if no title is available, the web page URL or file path. Footers show the web page URL or file path, and the date and time
of the download.

Page Layout tab
The Page Layout options specify a selection of page sizes and options for width, height, margin measurements, and page
orientation.
The Scaling options are as follows:
Scale Wide Contents To Fit Page Rescales the contents of a page, if necessary, to fit the width of the page. If this option

is not selected, the paper size adjusts to fit the contents of the page, if necessary.
Switch To Landscape If Scaled Smaller Than Changes the page orientation to landscape if the new version of a page is

less than the specified percentage of the original size. Available only if you selected portrait orientation.

HTML Conversion Settings
This dialog box opens when you select HTML on the General tab of the Web Page Conversion Settings dialog box and
then click the Settings button.
Default Encoding Lets you specify the following options:
Default Encoding Sets the input encoding of the file text from a menu of operating systems and alphabets.
Always Ignores any encoding that is specified in the HTML source file and uses the selection shown in the Default

Encoding option.
When Page Doesn’t Specify Encoding Uses the selection shown in the Default Encoding option only if the HTML

source file does not specify a type of encoding.
Language Specific Font Settings Use these settings to change the language script, body text typeface, and base typeface

size.
Default Colors Sets the default colors for text, page backgrounds, and web links. Click the color button to open a palette

and select the color. To use these colors in the PDF, select Force These Settings For All Pages. When this option is
unselected, the default colors are applied only for pages that don't have a specified color scheme.
Multimedia Content Determines whether to disable multimedia capture, embed multimedia files when possible, or
link to multimedia (such as SWF files) by URL.
Retain Page Background Specifies whether to display colors and tiled images in page backgrounds and colors in table

cells. If options are deselected, converted web pages sometimes look different than they do in a web browser, but are
easier to read when printed.
Convert Images Includes images in the conversion to PDF.
Underline Links Underlines textual web links on the pages.
Expand Scrollable Blocks Expands scrollable blocks to include complete information on the converted PDF.

Text Settings
Input Encoding Sets the input encoding of the text for a file.
Language Specific Font Settings Use these settings to change the language script, body text typeface, and base typeface

size.
Default Colors Sets the default colors for text and page backgrounds. Click the color button to open a palette, and select

the color.
Wrap Lines At Margin Inserts a soft return when the text reaches the edge of the text area on the page.

PDF fonts
Font embedding and substitution
A font can be embedded only if it contains a setting by the font vendor that permits it to be embedded. Embedding
prevents font substitution when readers view or print the file, and ensures that readers see the text in its original font.
Embedding increases file size only slightly, unless the document uses CID fonts. a font format commonly used for Asian
languages. You can embed or substitute fonts in Acrobat or when you export an InDesign document to PDF.

Last updated 5/10/2016

119
Creating PDFs

You can embed the entire font, or just a subset of the characters used in the file. Subsetting ensures that your fonts and
font metrics are used at print time by creating a custom font name. That way, for example, your version of Adobe
Garamond®, not your service provider’s version, can always be used by the service provider for viewing and printing.
Type 1 and TrueType fonts can be embedded if they are included in the PostScript file, or are available in one of the font
locations that Distiller monitors and are not restricted from embedding.
When a font cannot be embedded because of the font vendor’s settings, and someone who opens or prints a PDF does
not have access to the original font, a Multiple Master typeface is temporarily substituted: AdobeSerifMM for a missing
serif font, and AdobeSansMM for a missing sans serif font.
The Multiple Master typeface can stretch or condense to fit, to ensure that line and page breaks in the original
document are maintained. The substitution cannot always match the shape of the original characters, however,
especially if the characters are unconventional ones, such as script typefaces.
Note: For Asian text, Acrobat DC uses fonts from the installed Asian language kit or from similar fonts on the user’s system.
Fonts from some languages or with unknown encodings cannot be substituted; in these cases, the text appears as bullets in
the file.

If you have difficulty copying and pasting text from a PDF, first check if the problem font is embedded (File &amp;gt; Properties
&amp;gt; Font tab). For an embedded font, try changing the point where the font is embedded, rather than sending it inside the
PostScript file. Distill the PDF without embedding that font. Then open the PDF in Acrobat and embed the font using the
Preflight fixup.

Accessing and embedding fonts using Distiller
When converting a PostScript file to PDF, Distiller needs access to the file’s fonts to insert the appropriate information
in the PDF. Distiller first searches the PostScript file for Type 1, TrueType, and OpenType fonts. If the font isn’t
embedded in the PostScript file, Distiller searches additional font folders. Distiller searches the following font folders
in Windows:

• /Resource/Font in the Acrobat folder
• /Program Files/Common Files/Adobe/Fonts
Distiller searches the following font folders in Mac OS:

• /Resource/Font in the Acrobat folder
• /Users/[user name]/Library/Fonts
• /Library/Fonts
• /System/Library/Fonts
The Acrobat installation includes width-only versions of many common Chinese, Japanese, and Korean fonts,
therefore Distiller can then access these fonts in Acrobat. Make sure that the fonts are available on your computer.
(In Windows, choose Complete when you install Acrobat, or choose Custom and select the Asian Language Support
option under the View Adobe PDF category. In Mac OS, these fonts are installed automatically.)

Creating PDFs

For information on including fonts in a PostScript file, see the documentation that came with the application and
printer driver you use to create PostScript files.
Note: Distiller does not support Type 32 fonts.
To specify other font folders for Distiller to search, in Acrobat Distiller, choose Settings &amp;gt; Font Locations. Then in the
dialog box, click Add to add a font folder. Select Ignore TrueType Versions Of Standard PostScript Fonts to exclude
TrueType fonts that have the same name as a font in the PostScript 3 font collection.
Note: To provide Distiller with access to a font folder that has been moved, use this dialog box to remove the folder listed
in its old location and add it in its new location.

Preview PDFs without local fonts
You can create a printable preview of your document that substitutes default fonts for any text formatted in fonts that
are available on your local computer but are not embedded in the PDF. This preview can help you decide whether to
embed those local fonts in the PDF, to achieve the look you want for your document.
In the Preferences dialog box under Categories, select Page Display, and then deselect Use Local Fonts.
Note: If a font cannot be substituted, the text appears as bullets, and Acrobat displays an error message.

Find PostScript font names
If you need to enter a font name manually on the Fonts panel of the Adobe PDF Settings dialog box, you can use a PDF
to find the exact spelling of the name.
1 Use any application to create a one-page document with the font.
2 Create a PDF from the document.
3 Open the PDF in Acrobat DC, and choose File &amp;gt; Properties &amp;gt; Fonts.
4 Write down the name of the font, using the exact spelling, capitalization, and hyphenation of the name as it appears

in the Font Info dialog box.

Creating PDFs with Acrobat Distiller

Distiller preferences
The Distiller preferences control global Distiller settings. You set Distiller preferences by choosing File &amp;gt; Preferences
(Windows) or Distiller &amp;gt; Preferences (Mac OS).
Notify When Watched Folders Are Unavailable (Acrobat Pro) Returns a message if a watched folder becomes

unavailable or can’t be found.
(Windows) Notify When Windows TEMP Folder Is Nearly Full Warns you if available hard disk space is less than 1 MB.
Required hard disk space is often double the size of the PostScript file being processed.
Ask For PDF File Destination Lets you specify the name and location for files when using drag-and-drop or the Print

command.
Ask To Replace Existing PDF File Warns you if you are about to overwrite an existing PDF.
View PDF When Using Distiller Automatically opens the converted PDF.
Delete Log Files For Successful Jobs Creates a log file (named messages.log) only if there are messages from interpreting
the PostScript file or if a PostScript error occurs. (Log files for failed jobs are always created.)

Guidelines for creating PostScript files
If you want to fine-tune the creation of the PDF with Distiller parameters or pdfmark operators, first create a PostScript
file and then convert that file to PDF. For more information about the Adobe Acrobat DC SDK, see the Acrobat
Developer Center at www.adobe.com/go/learn_acr_devcenter_en (English only).
In authoring applications such as Adobe InDesign, use the Print command with the Adobe PDF printer to convert a
file to PostScript. The Print dialog boxes can vary from application to application. For instructions on creating a
PostScript file from your specific application, see the application documentation.
Keep in mind the following guidelines when creating PostScript files:

• Use PostScript Language Level 3 whenever possible to take advantage of the most advanced features of PostScript.
• Use the Adobe PDF printer as your PostScript printer.
• (Windows) Send the fonts used in the document.
Last updated 5/10/2016

123
Creating PDFs

• Give a PostScript file the same name as the original document, but with the extension .ps. (Some applications use a
.prn extension instead.)
• Use color and custom page sizes that are available with the Adobe Acrobat Distiller DC PPD file. Other PPD files
may cause inappropriate colors, fonts, or page sizes in the PDF.
• Send PostScript files as 8-bit binary data when using FTP to transfer the files between computers, especially if the
platforms are different. This action prevents converting line feeds to carriage returns or vice versa.

About watched folders (Acrobat Pro)
You can configure Distiller to look for PostScript files in certain folders called watched folders. Distiller can monitor
up to 100 watched folders. When Distiller finds a PostScript file located in the In folder of a watched folder, it converts
the file to PDF and then moves the PDF (and usually the PostScript file and any associated log file) to the Out folder.
A watched folder can have its own Adobe PDF settings and security settings that apply to all files processed from that
folder. Security settings for a watched folder take priority over the security settings for Distiller. For example, Distiller
does not convert a PostScript file in a watched folder if the file is marked with read-only permission.
(Windows) Settings and preferences are unique to each user. On a non-NT File System (NTFS), custom settings files
stored in this settings folder are read- and write-accessible by every user on the system. On an NTFS, only files created
by respective users are read- and write-accessible. Settings files created by other users are read-only. (The default
settings files installed with Adobe Acrobat Distiller DC are Read Only and Hidden.)
(Mac OS) Each user’s settings and preferences for Distiller are normally not accessible to any other user. To share a
watched folder with other users, the creator of the folder must set the appropriate permissions for the In and Out
folders. Sharing enables other users to copy files to the In folder and get files from the Out folder. The creator must be
logged into the system and have Distiller running. The other users must log in remotely to open the live watched folder
and have their files processed.
Note: You can’t set up watched folders as a network service for other users. Every user who creates PDFs must have an
Acrobat Pro license.

Set watched folders (Acrobat Pro)
1 In Acrobat Distiller DC, choose Settings &amp;gt; Watched Folders.
2 Click Add Folder, and select the target folder. Distiller automatically puts an In folder and an Out folder in the target

folder. You can place In and Out folders at any level of a disk drive.
3 To define security options for a folder, select the folder and click Edit Security. Click OK to return to the Watched

Folders dialog box.
Note: A security icon is prepended to any folder name for which security is set. To return a folder to the original options
selected in the Distiller window, select the folder, and click Clear Security.
4 Set Adobe PDF conversion settings for the folders:

• To edit the Adobe PDF settings to be applied to a folder, select the folder, click Edit Settings, and edit the Adobe
PDF settings. Click OK to save it to the watched folder as folder.joboptions.
• To use a different set of Adobe PDF settings, select the folder and click Load Settings. Use any settings that you
have defined, named, and saved, and then click OK.
5 Set options to manage the processing of files:

• Enter a number of seconds to specify how often to check the folders. You can enter up to 9999. (For example, 120
equals 2 minutes, and 9999 equals about 2-3/4 hours.)

Creating PDFs

• Choose what to do with a PostScript file after it has been processed. The file can be moved to the Out folder along
with the PDF file or deleted. Any log file is also automatically copied to the Out folder.
• To delete PDFs after a certain period of time, enter a number of days, up to 999. This option also deletes
PostScript and log files, if you have chosen to delete them.
6 If you want to remove a folder, select the folder and click Remove Folder. Make sure that Distiller has finished

processing all the files in the folder before you remove it.
Note: When you remove a watched folder, Distiller does not delete the In and Out folders, their contents, or the
folder.joboptions file. You can delete these manually when appropriate.

Adobe PDF conversion settings
Choose an Adobe PDF preset for converting files
1 Do one of the following:

• Start Acrobat Distiller.
• In an Adobe Creative Cloud application, choose File &amp;gt; Print, select Adobe PDF as the target printer, and click
Print Settings (Photoshop) or Setup &amp;gt; Preferences (InDesign).
• (Windows) In Office 2007 or later applications, choose Acrobat &amp;gt; Preferences.
• (Windows) In another authoring application or utility, choose Adobe PDF &amp;gt; Change Conversion Settings.
2 Choose a preset from the Default Settings (or Conversion Settings) menu.

Adobe PDF presets
A PDF preset is a group of settings that affect the process of creating a PDF. These settings are designed to balance file
size with quality, depending on how the PDF are used. Most predefined presets are shared across Adobe Creative Cloud
applications, including InDesign CC, Illustrator CC, Photoshop CC, and Acrobat DC. You can also create and share
custom presets for your unique output requirements. A saved PDF preset file has the suffix .joboptions.
A few of the following presets are not available until you move them from the Extras folder (where they installed by
default) to the Settings folder for custom settings.

Last updated 5/10/2016

125
Creating PDFs

Note: Acrobat Standard CC does not include the Extras folder. The presets installed in the Extras folder are only available
in Acrobat Pro DC.
Typically, the Extras and Settings folders for default settings are found at the following locations.

• (Windows XP) Documents and Settings/All Users/Application Data/Adobe/Adobe PDF
• (Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8) ProgramData/Adobe/Adobe PDF
• (Acrobat Pro DC on Mac OS) Library/Application Support/Adobe PDF
The default settings files installed with Distiller are Read Only and Hidden.

The custom settings are found in the following locations:

• (Windows XP) Documents and Settings/[username]/Application Data/Adobe/Adobe PDF/Settings
• (Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8) Users/[username]/AppData/Roaming/Adobe/Adobe PDF/Settings
• (Acrobat Pro DC on Mac OS) Users/[username]/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Adobe PDF/Settings

Some presets are not available in some Adobe Creative Cloud applications.
Review your PDF settings periodically. The settings do not automatically revert to the default settings. Applications and
utilities that create PDFs use the last set of PDF settings defined or selected.
High Quality Print Creates PDFs for quality printing on desktop printers and proofing devices. This preset uses PDF
1.4, downsamples color and grayscale images to 300 ppi and monochrome images to 1200 ppi. It also embeds subsets
of all fonts, leaves color unchanged, and does not flatten transparency (for file types capable of transparency). These
PDFs can be opened in Acrobat 5.0 and Acrobat Reader 5.0 and later.
Oversized Pages (Acrobat Pro) Creates PDFs suitable for viewing and printing of engineering drawings larger than 200

x 200 in. (508 x 508 cm). These PDFs can be opened in Acrobat and Reader 7.0 and later.
PDF/A-1b: 2005 (CMYK and RGB) Used for long-term preservation (archival) of electronic documents. PDF/A-1b uses

PDF 1.4 and converts all colors to either CMYK or RGB, depending on which standard you choose. These PDFs can
be opened in Acrobat and Reader versions 5.0 and later.
PDF/X-1a (2001 and 2003) (Acrobat Pro) PDF/X-1a requires all fonts to be embedded, the appropriate PDF bounding

boxes to be specified, and color to appear as CMYK, spot colors, or both. Compliant files must contain information
describing the printing condition for which they are prepared. PDF files created with PDF/X-1a compliance can be
opened in Acrobat 4.0 and Acrobat Reader 4.0 and later.
PDF/X-1a uses PDF 1.3, downsamples color and grayscale images to 300 ppi and monochrome images to 1200 ppi. It
embeds subsets of all fonts, creates untagged PDFs, and flattens transparency using the High Resolution setting.
Note: The PDF/X1-a:2003 and PDF/X-3 (2003) presets are placed on your computer during installation. However, they
aren’t available until you move them from the Extras folder to the Settings folder.
PDF/X-4 (2007) (Acrobat Pro) This preset is based on PDF 1.4, which includes support for live transparency. PDF/X-4
has the same color-management and International Color Consortium (ICC) color specifications as PDF/X-3. You can
create PDF/X-4-compliant files directly with Creative Suite 3 applications (Illustrator, InDesign, and Photoshop). In
Acrobat 9, use the Preflight feature to convert PDFs to PDF/X-4 DRAFT.

PDF files created with PDF/X-4 compliance can be opened in Acrobat 7.0 and Reader 7.0 and later.
Press Quality Creates PDF files for high-quality print production (for example, for digital printing or for color
separations to an imagesetter or platesetter). However, it does not create files that are PDF/X compliant. In this case,

Creating PDFs

the quality of the content is the highest consideration. The objective is to maintain all the information in a PDF file that
a commercial printer or print service provider requires to print the document correctly. This set of options uses PDF
1.4, converts colors to CMYK, and downsamples color and grayscale images to 300 ppi and monochrome images to
1200 ppi. It embeds subsets of all fonts and preserves transparency (for file types capable of transparency).
These PDF files can be opened in Acrobat 5.0 and Acrobat Reader 5.0 and later.
Note: Before creating a PDF file to send to a commercial printer or print service provider, find out what output resolution
and other settings are required. Or, ask for a .joboptions file with the recommended settings. You sometimes must customize
the Adobe PDF settings for a particular provider and then provide a .joboptions file of your own.
Rich Content PDF (Acrobat Pro DC) Creates accessible PDF files that include tags, hyperlinks, bookmarks, interactive
elements, and layers. This set of options uses PDF 1.6 and embeds subsets of all fonts. It also optimizes files for byte
serving. These PDF files can be opened in Acrobat and Reader 7.0 and later. (The Rich Content PDF preset is in the
Extras folder).

Note: This preset was called eBook in earlier versions of some applications.
Smallest File Size Creates PDF files for displaying on the web or an intranet, or for distribution through an email
system. This set of options uses compression, downsampling, and a relatively low image resolution. It converts all colors
to sRGB, and (for Adobe Acrobat Distiller-based conversions) does not embed fonts. It also optimizes files for byte
serving.

These PDF files can be opened in Acrobat and Reader 6.0 and later.
Standard Creates PDF files to be printed to desktop printers or digital copiers, published on a CD, or sent to a client as

a publishing proof. This set of options uses compression and downsampling to keep the file size down. However, it also
embeds subsets of all (allowed) fonts used in the file, converts all colors to sRGB, and prints to a medium resolution.
Windows font subsets are not embedded by default. PDF files created with this settings file can be opened in Acrobat
and Reader 6.0 and later.

About PDF/X, PDF/E, and PDF/A standards
PDF/X, PDF/E, and PDF/A standards are defined by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). PDF/X
standards apply to graphic content exchange; PDF/E standards apply to the interactive exchange of engineering
documents; PDF/A standards apply to long-term archiving of electronic documents. During PDF conversion, the file
that is being processed is checked against the specified standard. If the PDF does not meet the selected ISO standard,
you are prompted to either cancel the conversion or create a non-compliant file.
The most widely used standards for a print publishing workflow are several PDF/X formats: PDF/X-1a, PDF/X-3, and
(in 2008) PDF/X-4. The most widely used standards for PDF archiving are PDF/A-1a and PDF/A-1b (for less stringent
requirements). Currently, the only version of PDF/E is PDF/E-1.
For more information on PDF/X, PDF/E, and PDF/A, see the ISO and AIIM websites.
For details on creating and working with PDF/A files, see www.adobe.com/go/learn_acr_pdfa_en.

Customize Adobe PDF settings
You may want to create custom conversion settings for certain jobs or output devices. The selections you make
determine such things as whether the document fonts are embedded and subsetted at 100%, how vector objects and
images are compressed and/or sampled, and whether the resulting PDF includes high-end printing information such
as OPI (Open Prepress Interface) comments. Default settings files cannot be modified, but can be duplicated to help
create new settings files.

Last updated 5/10/2016

127
Creating PDFs

Note: If the PDF is intended for high-end printing, ask your service provider for their custom .joboptions file with the
recommended output resolution and other settings. This way, the PDF you give them will have characteristics optimized
for your print workflow.

Create a custom Adobe PDF settings file
1 Do one of the following:

• In Acrobat Distiller, select one of the predefined sets of options from the Default Settings menu to use as a
starting point, and then choose Settings &amp;gt; Edit Adobe PDF Settings.
• In authoring applications or utilities, select Adobe PDF as the target printer—typically in the Page Setup or Print
dialog boxes—and click Properties.
• (Windows) In the Acrobat PDFMaker dialog box, clickAdvanced Settings in the Settings tab.
Note: In Windows, you can switch to a different preset from within the Adobe PDF Settings dialog box. To do
this, select Show All Settings at the bottom left and then select a preset from the list on the left.

2 Select panels one at a time, and make changes as needed.
3 Save your customized preset in one of the following ways:

• Click OK to save a duplicate of the custom preset file, which will automatically be renamed. For example, if you
edit the Press Quality preset, your first customized version appears as Press Quality (1).
• Click Save As, type a new descriptive name for the file, and click Save.
The custom file is saved in (Windows) /Documents and Settings/[user name]/Application Data/Adobe/Adobe
PDF/Settings, (Vista/7/8) User/[user name]/AppData/Roaming/Adobe/Adobe PDF/Settings, or (Mac OS)
Users/[user name]/Library/Application Support/Adobe PDF/Settings.

Delete custom Adobe PDF settings files
1 In Acrobat Distiller, choose Settings &amp;gt; Remove Adobe PDF Settings.
2 Select the custom file and click Remove.
3 Repeat step 2 as needed, and then click Cancel to close the Remove Adobe PDF Settings dialog box.

Creating PDFs

Adobe PDF settings
The Acrobat Distiller Adobe PDFMaker Settings &amp;gt; Advanced Settings contains panels of options that you can select to
customize your PDF output.

General panel options
Use this panel to select a version of Acrobat for file compatibility and other file and device settings.
Compatibility Sets the compatibility level of the PDF. Use the most recent version (in this case, version 1.7) to include
all the latest features and functionality. If you’re creating PDFs that will be distributed widely, choose an earlier level, to
ensure that all users can view and print the document.
Object Level Compression Compresses structural information (such as bookmarks, accessibility, and noncompressible

objects), making this information neither visible or usable in Acrobat 5.0 or Reader 5.0. Tags Only compresses
structural information; Off applies no compression.
Auto-Rotate Pages Automatically rotates pages according to the direction of text.

Note: If Process DSC Comments is selected in the Advanced panel and if %%Viewing Orientation comments are included,
these comments take precedence in determining page orientation.
Collectively By File Rotates all pages to match the orientation of the majority of text in the document.
Individually Rotates each page based on the orientation of the text on that page.
Off Prevents pages from rotating.
Binding Specifies whether to display a PDF with left side or right side binding. The Binding setting affects the

appearance of pages in the Two-Up Continuous view and the appearance of thumbnails side by side.
Resolution Use for PostScript files to emulate resolutions based on the printer they are printing to. Permitted values

range from 72 to 4000. Use the default setting unless you plan to print the PDF on a specific printer while emulating
the resolution defined in the original PostScript file.
Note: Increasing the resolution setting increases file size and may slightly increase the time required to process some files.
Pages Specifies which pages to convert to PDF.
Embed Thumbnails Embeds a thumbnail preview for each page in the PDF, increasing the file size. Deselect this setting
when users of Acrobat 5.0 and later will view and print the PDF; these versions generate thumbnails dynamically each
time you click the Pages panel of a PDF.
Optimize For Fast Web View Restructures the file for faster access (page-at-a-time downloading, or byte serving) from

web servers. This option compresses text and line art, overriding compression selections on the Images panel.
Default Page Size Specifies the page size to use when one is not specified in the original file. EPS files give a bounding

box size, not a page size.

Images panel options
The options in the Images panel specify compression and resampling for color, grayscale, and monochrome images.
You may want to experiment with these options to find an appropriate balance between file size and image quality.
The resolution setting for color and grayscale images should be 1.5 to 2 times the line screen ruling at which the file
will be printed. The resolution for monochrome images should be the same as the output device, but be aware that
saving a monochrome image at a resolution higher than 1500 dpi increases the file size without noticeably improving
image quality. Images that will be magnified, such as maps, may require higher resolutions.

Last updated 5/10/2016

Creating PDFs

Note: Resampling monochrome images can have unexpected viewing results, such as no image display. If this happens, turn
off resampling and convert the file again. This problem is most likely to occur with subsampling, and least likely with bicubic
downsampling.
The following table shows common types of printers and their resolution measured in dpi, their default screen ruling
measured in lines per inch (lpi), and a resampling resolution for images measured in pixels per inch (ppi). For example,
if you were printing to a 600-dpi laser printer, you would enter 170 for the resolution at which to resample images.

Downsample (Off) Reduces image resolutions that exceed the For Images Above value to the resolution of the output

device by combining pixels in a sample area of the image to make one larger pixel.
Average Downsampling To Averages the pixels in a sample area and replaces the entire area with the average pixel color

at the specified resolution.
Subsampling To Replaces an entire area with a pixel selected from that sample area, at the specified resolution. Causes
faster conversion time than downsampling, but resulting images are less smooth and continuous.
Bicubic Downsampling To Uses a weighted average, instead of a simple average (as in downsampling) to determine

pixel color. This method is slowest but produces the smoothest tonal gradations.
Compression/Image Quality Applies compression to color, grayscale, and monochrome images. For color and
grayscale images, also sets the image quality.
Anti-Alias To Gray Smooths jagged edges in monochrome images. Choose 2 bit, 4 bit, or 8 bit to specify 4, 16, or 256

levels of gray. (Anti-aliasing may cause small type or thin lines to look blurry.)
Note: Compression of text and line art is always on. To turn it off, set the appropriate Distiller parameter. For details, see
the SDK information on the Acrobat Developer Center at www.adobe.com/go/learn_acr_devcenter_en (PDF, English
only).
Policy Opens the Image Policy dialog box, where you can set processing options for Color, Grayscale, and

Monochrome images that are less than the resolutions you specify. For each type of image, enter a resolution value, and
then choose Ignore, Warn And Continue, or Cancel Job.

Fonts panel options
The Fonts options specify which fonts to embed in a PDF, and whether to embed a subset of characters used in the PDF.
You can embed OpenType®, TrueType, and PostScript fonts. Fonts that have license restrictions are listed with a lock
. If you select a font that has a license restriction, the nature of the restriction is described in the Adobe PDF
icon
Options dialog box.
Note: When you combine PDF files that have the same font subset, Acrobat attempts to combine the font subsets.
Embed All Fonts Embeds all fonts used in the file. Font embedding is required for PDF/X compliance.
Embed OpenType Fonts Embeds all OpenType fonts used in the file, and maintains OpenType font information for

advanced line layout. This option is available only if either Acrobat 7.0 (PDF 1.6) or Acrobat 8 (PDF 1.7) is selected
from the Compatibility menu in the General panel.

Subset Embedded Fonts When Percent Of Characters Used Is Less Than Specifies a threshold percentage if you want to
embed only a subset of the fonts. For example, if the threshold is 35, and fewer than 35% of the characters are used,
Distiller embeds only those characters.
When Embedding Fails Specifies how Distiller responds if it cannot find a font to embed when processing a file.
Always Embed To embed only certain fonts, move them into the Always Embed list. Make sure that Embed All Fonts

is not selected.
Never Embed Move fonts that you do not want to embed to this list. If necessary, choose a different font folder from

the pop-up menu to display the font in the font list.
Note: Fonts that have license restrictions are listed with a lock icon. If you select a font with a license restriction, the nature
of the restriction is described in the Adobe PDF Options dialog box.
Add Name If the font you want is not in a font folder, click Add Name. Enter the name of the font, select Always Embed

List (or Never Embed List), and click Add.
Note: A TrueType font can contain a setting added by the font designer that prevents the font from being embedded in PDF
files.
Remove Removes a font from the Always Embed or Never Embed list. This action doesn’t remove the font from your

system; it removes the reference to the font from the list.
Note: Acrobat does not include the Times, Helvetica, and ZapfDingbats fonts. If you want PDF recipients to view and print
these fonts in PDFs that you create, embed the fonts.

Color panel options
Whether you’re using color management information in the PostScript file, using Distiller CSFs, or defining custom
settings, you set all color management information for Distiller on the Color panel of the Adobe PDF Settings dialog
box.
Settings File Lists color settings, including those used in graphics applications. The None setting lets you edit the Color

Management Policies and Working Spaces settings.
Color Management Policies Specifies how Distiller converts unmanaged color in a PostScript file when you don’t use a
Distiller color settings file. This menu is available when None is selected in the Settings File menu.

Note: Color Management Policies values may affect a PDF differently depending on the compatibility setting you choose in
the General panel.
Leave Color Unchanged Leaves device-dependent colors unchanged and preserves device-independent colors as the
nearest possible equivalent. This is a useful option for print shops that have calibrated their devices, have used that
information to specify color in the file, and are only outputting to those devices.
Tag (Or Convert) Everything For Color Management Tags color objects with an ICC profile and calibrates colors,

making them device-independent in PDFs compatible with Acrobat 4.0 (PDF 1.3) and later. Converts devicedependent color spaces in images (RGB, Grayscale, and CMYK) to device-independent color spaces (CalRGB, CalGray,
and Cie L*a*b) in Acrobat 3.0 (PDF 1.2) compatible PDFs.
Tag (Or Convert) Only Images For Color Management Tags ICC profiles in images only (not text or vector objects),

which prevents black text from undergoing any color shift when distilling Acrobat 4.0 (PDF 1.3) compatible PDFs.
Converts device-dependent color spaces in images (RGB, Grayscale, and CMYK) to device-independent color spaces
(CalRGB, CalGray, and Lab) in Acrobat 3.0 (PDF 1.2) compatible PDFs.
Convert All Colors To sRGB (or Convert Everything To CalRGB) Calibrates color, making it device-independent.

Creating PDFs

and RGB images to calibrated RGB (CalRGB) in Acrobat 3.0 (PDF 1.2) compatible PDFs. Recommended for PDFs that
will be used onscreen or with low-resolution printers.
Convert All Colors To CMYK Converts color spaces to DeviceGray or DeviceCMYK according to the options specified

in the Working Spaces menu. All Working Spaces must be specified.
Document Rendering Intent Choose a method to map colors between color spaces. The result of any particular method

depends on the profiles of the color spaces. For example, some profiles produce identical results with different methods.
Acrobat shares four rendering intents (Perceptual, Saturation, Relative Colorimetric, and Absolute Colorimetric) with
other Creative Suite applications.
Acrobat also includes a rendering intent called Preserve, which indicates that the intent is specified in the output device
rather than in the PDF. In many output devices, Relative Colorimetric is the default intent.
Note: In all cases, intents may be ignored or overridden by color management operations that occur subsequent to the
creation of the PDF file.
Working Spaces For all Color Management Policies values other than Leave Color Unchanged, choose a working space

to specify which ICC profiles are used for defining and calibrating the grayscale, RGB, and CMYK color spaces in
distilled PDFs.
Gray Choose a profile to define the color space of all grayscale images in files. The default ICC profile for gray images

is Adobe Gray - 20% Dot Gain. Choose None to prevent grayscale images from being converted.
RGB Choose a profile to define the color space of all RGB images in files. The default, sRGB IEC61966-2.1, is

recognized by many output devices. Choose None to prevent RGB images from being converted.
CMYK Choose a profile to define the color space of all CMYK images in files. The default is U.S. Web Coated (SWOP)
v2. Choose None to prevent CMYK images from being converted.

Note: Choosing None for all three working spaces has the same effect as selecting the option Leave Color Unchanged.
You can add ICC profiles (such as ones provided by your print service bureau) by placing them in the ICCProfiles folder
in the Common folder, the Windows\System\Color folder (Windows), or the System Folder/ColorSync folder (Mac OS).
Preserve CMYK Values For Calibrated CMYK Color Spaces When selected, device-independent CMYK values are

treated as device-dependent (DeviceCMYK) values, device-independent color spaces are discarded, and PDF/X-1a
files use the Convert All Colors To CMYK value. When deselected, device-independent color spaces convert to CMYK,
provided that Color Management Policies is set to Convert All Colors To CMYK.
Preserve Under Color Removal And Black Generation Retains these settings if they exist in the PostScript file. Black
generation calculates the amount of black to use when reproducing a color. Undercolor removal (UCR) reduces cyan,
magenta, and yellow to compensate for black generation. Because UCR uses less ink, it’s suitable for uncoated stock.
When Transfer Functions Are Found Specifies how to handle transfer functions in PDFs. Transfer functions are used
for artistic effect and to correct for the characteristics of a specific output device.
Remove Deletes any applied transfer functions. Applied transfer functions should be removed, unless the PDF is to be
output to the same device that the source PostScript file was created for.
Preserve Retains the transfer functions traditionally used to compensate for dot gain or dot loss that may occur when

an image is transferred to film. Dot gain or loss occurs when the ink dots that make up a printed image are larger or
smaller than in the halftone screen.
Apply Applies the transfer function, changing the colors in the file but doesn’t keep it. This method is useful for

creating color effects in a file.
Preserve Halftone Information Retains any halftone information in files. Halftone information is intended for use with

a particular output device.

Advanced panel options
Advanced options specify which Document Structuring Conventions (DSC) comments to keep in a PDF and how to
set other options that affect the conversion from PostScript. In a PostScript file, DSC comments contain information
about the file (such as the originating application, the creation date, and the page orientation) and provide structure for
page descriptions in the file (such as beginning and ending statements for a prologue section). DSC comments can be
useful when your document is going to print or press.
For more information, see the documents on the Adobe PDF Technology Center at
www.adobe.com/go/learn_acr_pdftechnology_en (PDF, English only).
Note: The ASCII Format option has been removed from Distiller, but is still available as a Distiller parameter.
Allow PostScript File To Override Adobe PDF Settings Uses settings stored in a PostScript file rather than the current

PDF settings file. For more information about customizing PDF settings, see the SDK information on the Acrobat
Developer Center at www.adobe.com/go/learn_acr_devcenter_en (PDF, English only).
Allow PostScript XObjects PostScript XObjects store fragments of PostScript code to be used when a PDF is printed on

a PostScript printer. Use only in controlled workflows where there is no other option. Available when the Standard or
Smallest File Size is selected from the Default Settings menu.
Convert Gradients To Smooth Shades Converts blends to smooth shades for Acrobat 4.0 and later, improving quality
and reducing file size of PDFs. Distiller converts gradients from Adobe Illustrator, Adobe InDesign, Adobe FreeHand®,
CorelDraw, QuarkXPress, and Microsoft PowerPoint.
Convert Smooth Lines To Curves Reduces the amount of control points used to build curves in CAD drawings, which

results in smaller PDFs and faster onscreen rendering.
Preserve Level 2 Copypage Semantics Uses the copypage operator defined in PostScript Level 2 rather than in

Language Level 3 PostScript. If you have a PostScript file and select this option, a copypage operator copies the page. If
this option is not selected, the equivalent of a showpage operation is executed, except that the graphics state is not
reinitialized.
Preserve Overprint Settings Retains any overprint settings in files being converted to PDF. Overprint settings create
color by printing one ink on top of another ink.
Overprinting Default Is Nonzero Overprinting Prevents overprinted objects with zero CMYK values from knocking

out CMYK objects beneath them.
Save Adobe PDF Settings Inside PDF File Embeds the settings file (.joboptions) used to create the PDF as an
attachment. (To view the settings file, choose View &amp;gt; Show/Hide &amp;gt; Navigation Panes &amp;gt; Attachments in Acrobat.)
Save Original JPEG Image In PDF If Possible Processes compressed JPEG images (images that are already compressed
using DCT encoding) without recompressing them. When deselected, performance improves because only
decompression, not recompression, occurs.
Save Portable Job Ticket Inside PDF File Preserves a PostScript job ticket in a PDF. Job tickets describe the PostScript

file and can be used later in a workflow or for printing the PDF.
Use Prologue.ps and Epilogue.ps Sends a prologue and epilogue file with each job. These files can be used to add
custom PostScript code that you want to have executed at the beginning or end of every PostScript job being converted.

Sample Prologue.ps and Epilogue.ps files are located in (Windows) /Documents and Settings/All Users/Application

Standards panel options
By using Standards options, you can check document content in the PostScript file to make sure it meets standard
PDF/X1-a, PDF/X-3, or PDF/A criteria before creating the PDF. For PDF/X-compliant files, you can also require that
the PostScript file meet additional criteria by selecting options in the Standards panel. The availability of options
depends on the standard you select. You can also create a PDF/X file from a compliant PDF by using the Preflight
feature in Acrobat.
PDF/X-compliant Complies with the PDF/X standard for high-resolution print production.

Note: PDFMaker, the conversion method used to convert Microsoft Word and other application files to PDF, does not create
PDF/X-compliant files.
PDF/A-compliant Complies with the PDF/A standard for archival documents.

Note: If you set up a watched folder for creating PDF/A-compliant files in Acrobat Pro, do not add security to the folder.
The PDF/A standard does not allow encryption.
Compliance Standard Produces a report that indicates whether the file complies with the standard you select, and if

not, what problems were encountered. The .log file appears at the bottom of the dialog box.
Note: PDFs that complied with both PDF/X-1a and PDF/X-3 standards in Acrobat 6.0 default to PDF/X-1a in Acrobat XI.
When Not Compliant Specifies whether to create the PDF if the PostScript file does not comply with the requirements

of the standard.
Continue Creates a PDF even if the PostScript file does not meet the requirements of the standard, and notes these

problems in the report.
Cancel Job Creates a PDF only if the PostScript file meets the requirements of the standard, and is otherwise valid.

Trapped (Acrobat Pro DC) Indicates the state of trapping in the document. PDF/X compliance requires a value of True
or False. If the document does not specify the trapped state, the value provided here is used. If your workflow requires
that the document specify the trapped state, choose Leave Undefined.

PDF compatibility levels
When you create PDFs, you need to decide which PDF version to use. You can change the PDF version by switching to
a different preset or choosing a compatibility option when you save as PDF or edit a PDF preset.
Generally speaking, unless there’s a specific need for backward compatibility, you should use the most recent version
(in this case version 1.7). The latest version will include all the newest features and functionality. However, if you’re
creating documents that will be distributed widely, consider choosing Acrobat 5.0 (PDF 1.4) or Acrobat 6.0 (PDF 1.5)
to ensure that all users can view and print the document.
The following table compares some of the functionality in PDFs created using the different compatibility settings.
Note: Acrobat 8.0 and 9.0 also use PDF 1.7.

Compressing and downsampling images
When converting PostScript files to PDF, you can compress vector objects (such as text and line art) and compress and
downsample images. Line art is described with a mathematical equation and is usually created with a drawing program
such as Adobe Illustrator. Images—whether color, monochrome, or grayscale—are described as pixels and are created
with applications like Adobe Photoshop or by scanning. Monochrome images include most black-and-white
illustrations made by paint programs and any images scanned with an image depth of 1 bit.
When you downsample (or decrease the number of pixels), information is deleted from the image. With Distiller, you
specify an interpolation method—average downsampling, bicubic downsampling, or subsampling—to determine how
pixels are deleted. Depending on the settings you choose, compression and downsampling can significantly reduce the
size of a PDF with little or no loss of detail and precision.
When Distiller processes a file, it normally applies the compression settings to images throughout the file. However,
you can assign different compression and downsampling methods to individual images.
Varying the compression and downsampling methods within a PDF
Before you create a PDF, you can take various approaches to applying different compression and downsampling options
to the individual images that will go into that PDF:

• Use Adobe PhotoshopCC to resample and compress existing image files before using Distiller. When you are ready
to create the PDF in Distiller, be careful to deselect the compression and downsampling or subsampling options.
• Create separate PostScript files for each part of the document that you want to process differently, and use different
compression options to distill each part. Then use Distiller to merge the files into a single PDF.
• When you create color, grayscale, and monochrome images in an art application (such as Adobe Photoshop CC),
select the compression and downsampling settings that you want when you save each image from within that
application.
• Insert Distiller parameters before images in a PostScript file. You can use this technique to process every image in a
document differently. This technique is the most difficult, because it requires knowledge of PostScript
programming. For more information on using parameters, see the SDK documentation on the Acrobat Developer
Center at www.adobe.com/go/learn_acr_devcenter_en(English only).
Note: To apply the inserted Distiller parameters, select Allow PostScript File To Override Adobe PDF Settings on the
Advanced panel of the Adobe PDF Settings dialog box in Distiller. This option overrides settings you selected in the Adobe
PDF dialog box.

Compression methods
Distiller applies ZIP compression to text and line art, ZIP or JPEG compression to color and grayscale images, and ZIP,
CCITT Group 3 or 4, or Run Length compression to monochrome images.

Last updated 5/10/2016

137
Creating PDFs

A ZIP B JPEG C CCITT D Run Length

You can choose from the following compression methods:
ZIP Works well on images with large areas of single colors or repeating patterns, and for black-and-white images that

contain repeating patterns. Acrobat supports only 8-bit ZIP compression, which is lossless; that is, data is not removed
to reduce file size, so image quality is not affected.

Note: Adobe implementation of the ZIP filter is derived from the zlib package of Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler, whose
generous assistance we gratefully acknowledge.
JPEG Suitable for grayscale or color images, such as continuous-tone photographs. JPEG is lossy, which means that it
removes image data and may reduce image quality; however, it attempts to reduce file size with the minimum loss of
information. Because JPEG compression eliminates data, it can achieve much smaller file sizes than ZIP compression.
CCITT Available only for monochrome bitmap images. CCITT (Consultative Committee on International Telegraphy

and Telephony) compression is appropriate for black-and-white images and any images scanned with an image depth
of 1 bit. Group 4 is a general-purpose method that produces good compression for most monochrome images. Group
3, used by most fax machines, compresses monochrome images one row at a time.
Run Length Produces the best results for images that contain large areas of solid white or black.

Edit text in PDFs
Easily correct, update, and add text to PDF files. Reflow paragraphs and correct typos— without returning to your
original source document. Use the Add Text tool to fill in noninteractive PDF forms.
This document provides instructions for Acrobat DC. If you're using Acrobat Reader DC, see What can I do with Adobe
Reader. If you're using Acrobat XI, see Acrobat XI Help .

Edit text in a PDF
The Edit Text &amp; Images tool lets you replace, edit, or add text to a PDF. You can correct typos, change fonts and typeface
size, adjust alignment, add superscripts or subscripts, and resize text or paragraphs.

You edit a PDF one page at a time. For more extensive editing or to make global formatting changes across the entire
document, edit the original document. If the original isn’t available, you can save the PDF as a Microsoft Word
document or PowerPoint presentation. Then edit, and re-create the PDF.

To add or remove items from a numbered or bulleted list:

• You can add or remove items to the list at all nested levels using the same familiar controls that you use in MS
Office. For example, press Enter at the end of a list item to insert a new row. Press Backspace to remove the new
row and position the cursor back to the end of previous list item.
To create a numbered or bulleted list:
a Place the cursor in the document at the location where you want to add a new list.
b Choose the appropriate list type (bulleted or numbered) under Format in the right pane.

To convert an existing paragraph to a list item:

• Place the cursor in the paragraph, and then choose the appropriate list type (bulleted or numbered) under
Format in the right pane.
To convert an existing list item to a paragraph:
c Select all items in the list. The appropriate list type is highlighted under Format in the right pane.
d Click the highlighted list type.

To convert from one list type to another:
e Place the cursor in the list item or select all items in the list.
f Choose the appropriate list type (bulleted or numbered) under Format in the right pane.

You can also use Keyboard to add a list item. For example, before a paragraph, you can type number ‘a’ followed by
the closing parenthesis ‘)’ and then add one space. It adds a numbered list starting with “a)”.

Move, rotate, or resize a text box
You can move or rotate text boxes on a page. The Edit Text &amp; Images tool outlines each text box, so it is clear what text
is affected. Edits are confined to the page. You cannot drag a text block to another page, or move or rotate individual
characters or words within a text box. However, you can copy text boxes and paste them on another page.
Resizing a text box causes the text to reflow within the new text box boundaries. It does not change the size of the text.
To change the font size, see Edit or format text in a PDF. As with other text edits, resizing is limited to the current page.
Text does not flow to the next page.

To rotate the selected image manually, place the pointer just outside a selection handle. When the cursor changes to the
rotation pointer
, drag in the direction you want it to rotate.

Move an image or object in front or behind other elements
The Arrange options let you move an image or object in front of or behind other elements. You can push an item
forward or back just one level, or send it to the front or back of the stacking order of elements on the page.
1 Choose Tools &amp;gt; Edit PDF &amp;gt; Edit

.

2 Select the object (or objects).
3 Under Objects in the right hand panel, click Arrange

and choose the appropriate option.

Alternatively, you can right-click the object (or objects), and point to Arrange and then choose the appropriate
option.
For complex pages where it is hard to select an object, you may find it easier to change the order using the Content
tab. (Choose View &amp;gt; Show/Hide &amp;gt; Navigation Panes &amp;gt; Content.)

Align images or objects
The Align Objects options let you precisely align multiple objects on a side - Left, Vertical Centre, Right, Top,
Horizontal Centre, and Bottom.
When you align objects relative to each other by their edges, one of the objects remains stationary. For example, the Left
option aligns the left edges of the selected objects with respect to the left edge of the leftmost object. The leftmost object
remains stationary, and the other objects are aligned relative to it.

Last updated 5/10/2016

Editing PDFs

The Horizontal Centre option aligns the selected objects horizontally through the centre of the objects, and the Vertical
Centre option aligns the selected objects vertically through the centers of the objects. The objects are aligned along a
horizontal or vertical line that represents the average of their original positions. An object can remain stationary, if it is
already aligned to the horizontal or vertical line.
Depending on the alignment option you select, objects move straight up, down, left, or right, and might overlap an
object already located there. If you see an overlap, you can undo the alignment.
1 Choose Tools &amp;gt; Edit PDF &amp;gt; Edit
2 Select the object (or objects).
3 Under Objects in the right hand panel, click Align Objects

and choose the appropriate alignment

option.
Alternatively, you can right-click the object (or objects), and point to the Align Objects option from the context
menu and then select the desired alignment option from the submenu.

Edit an image outside Acrobat
You can edit an image or graphic using another application, such as Photoshop, Illustrator, or Microsoft Paint. When
you save the image or graphic, Acrobat automatically updates the PDF with the changes. The applications that appear
in the Edit Using menu depend upon what you have installed and the type of image or graphic you have selected.
Optionally, you can specify the application you want to use.
1 Choose Tools &amp;gt; Edit PDF &amp;gt; Edit
2 Select the image or object.

Select multiple items if you want to edit them together in the same file. To edit all the images and objects on the page,
right-click the page, and choose Select All.
3 Under Objects in the right hand panel, click Edit Using

and then choose an editor.

To choose a different editor than offered on the menu, select Open With, locate the application, and click Open.
Note: If a message asks whether to convert to ICC profiles, choose Don’t Convert. If the image window displays a
checkerboard pattern when it opens, the image data could not be read.
4 Make the desired changes in the external editing application. Keep in mind the following restrictions:

• If you change the dimensions of the image, the image may not align correctly in the PDF.
• Transparency information is preserved only for masks that are specified as index values in an indexed color
space.
• If you are working in Photoshop, flatten the image.
• Image masks are not supported.
• If you change image modes while editing the image, you may lose valuable information that can be applied only
in the original mode.
5 In the editing application, choose File &amp;gt; Save. The object is automatically updated and displayed in the PDF when

you bring Acrobat DC to the foreground.
Note: For Photoshop, if the image is in a format supported by Photoshop 6.0 or later, your edited image is saved back
into the PDF. However, if the image is in an unsupported format, Photoshop handles the image as a generic PDF image,
and the edited image is saved to disk instead of back into the PDF.

Delete or replace pages
You can replace an entire PDF page with another PDF page. Only the text and images on the original page are replaced.
Any interactive elements associated with the original page, such as links and bookmarks, are not affected. Likewise,
bookmarks and links that may have been previously associated with the replacement page do not carry over.
Comments, however, are carried over and are combined with any existing comments in the document.
After you delete or replace pages, it’s a good idea to use the Reduce File Size command to rename and save the
restructured document to the smallest possible file size.

Delete pages, using the Delete command

the page number you selected to drop the new pages on.

Renumber pages
The page numbers on the document pages do not always match the page numbers that appear below the page
thumbnails and in the Page Navigation toolbar. Pages are numbered with integers, starting with page 1 for the first page
of the document. Because some PDFs may contain front matter, such as a copyright page and table of contents, their
body pages may not follow the numbering shown in the Page Navigation toolbar.

• Revert to Image (or Convert to text): It allows switching from text-to-image or image-to-text editing mode. For
more information, see Enable or disable auto-OCR for scanned documents.

Settings - OCR language, system fonts, and all pages editable
Use the settings to change OCR language, choose whether to use system fonts, and make all pages editable at one go.
Click Settings in the right pane under Scanned Documents. The dialog box shows the following three settings:

• Recognize Text in (OCR language): By default the OCR language is picked from default locale.
• Use available system font: If this option is checked, during the process of scanned to editable text conversion, the
converted text is displayed in a font that is installed on the system and is a closest match to the original font in the
scanned page.
• Make all the pages editable: if this option is checked, then all pages of the current document are converted to
editable text in one go. It is a relatively slower option. Use this option only if you want to edit all pages or convert all
pages to editable text.
Initially, the language is set to the default locale and the other options are disabled. Any changes to these settings remain
persistent and are applied when you enter in the edit mode (Tools &amp;gt; Edit PDF).

Enable or disable auto-OCR for scanned documents
The OCR is turned on by default. Therefore, when you open a scanned document for editing, the current page is

Optimizing PDFs
Save using PDF Optimizer (Acrobat Pro DC)
PDF Optimizer provides many settings for reducing the size of PDF files. Some of the PDF Optimizer settings are
comparable to the settings that are available when you create a PDF file using Distiller. Whether you use all of these
settings or only a few depends on how you intend to use the files and on the essential properties a file must have. In
most cases, the default settings are appropriate for maximum efficiency—saving space by removing embedded fonts,
compressing images, and removing items from the file that are no longer needed.
Before you optimize a file, it’s a good idea to audit the file’s space usage. The space audit results may give you ideas about
where best to reduce file size. You can also reduce the size of your PDF by using the Reduce File Size command.
Note: Some methods of compression may make images unusable in a print production workflow. You should experiment
with various settings before making changes that can’t be discarded.

Open the PDF Optimizer
In a single PDF, choose File &amp;gt; Save As Other &amp;gt; Optimized PDF.
Note: The PDF Optimizer isn’t available when Reflow is selected in the View menu.

Audit the space usage of a PDF (Acrobat Pro DC)
Auditing the space usage gives you a report of the total number of bytes used for specific document elements, including
fonts, images, bookmarks, forms, named destinations, and comments, as well as the total file size. The results are
reported both in bytes and as a percentage of the total file size.
1 Choose File &amp;gt; Save As Other &amp;gt; Optimized PDF. The PDF Optimizer dialog box opens.
2 Click the Audit Space Usage button at the top of the dialog box.

You can also audit space usage of a PDF in the Content pane. Choose View &amp;gt; Show/Hide &amp;gt; Navigation Panes &amp;gt;
Content. From the Content pane options menu
, choose Audit Space Usage.

Optimize a PDF (Acrobat Pro DC)
1 Open the PDF Optimizer dialog box (File &amp;gt; Save As Other &amp;gt; Optimized PDF).
2 To use the default settings, choose Standard from the Settings menu, and then skip to step 6. If you change any

settings in the PDF Optimizer dialog box, the Settings menu automatically switches to Custom.
3 From the Make Compatible With menu, choose Retain Existing to keep the current PDF version, or choose an

Acrobat version. (The options available in panels vary depending on this choice.)
4 Select the check box next to a panel (for example, Images, Fonts, Transparency), and then select options in that

panel. To prevent all of the options in a panel from executing during optimization, deselect the check box for that
panel.

Downsample Reduces file size by lowering the resolution of images, which involves merging the colors of original

pixels into larger pixels.

Editing PDFs

Note: Masked images and images with a size less than 16-by-16 pixels are not downsampled.
Compression Reduces file size by eliminating unnecessary pixel data. In general, JPEG and JPEG 2000 compression

give better results on images like photographs with gradual transitions from color to color. ZIP is the better choice for
illustrations with large areas of solid, flat color, or patterns made up of flat colors. For monochrome images, JBIG2
compression, which is available in PDF Optimizer but not in Distiller, and it is superior to CCITT.
Quality Available only for JPEG and JPEG 2000 formats. JPEG and JPEG 2000 compression methods are typically lossy,
a process that permanently removes some pixel data. You can apply lossy JPEG or JPEG 2000 compression to color
images at various levels (Minimum, Low, Medium, High, Maximum). For JPEG 2000 compression, you can also specify
lossless so that no pixel data is removed. Compression for monochrome images is lossless, except for JBIG2
compression, which provides both Lossy and Lossless modes of compression.
Tile Size Available only for JPEG 2000 format. Divides the image being compressed into tiles of the given size. (If the

image height or width is not an even multiple of the tile size, partial tiles are used on the edges.) Image data for each
tile is individually compressed and can be individually decompressed. The default value of 256 is recommended.
Optimize Images Only If There Is A Reduction In Size When selected, if the image setting will cause an increase in file

size, the optimization for that image is skipped.

Fonts panel
To ensure an exact match to the source document, it’s a good idea to embed all fonts used in the document. If you don’t
need an exact match and you prefer a smaller file, you can choose not to embed fonts for roman text and East Asian
text (Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Korean, and Japanese). Text in these languages is replaced with a
substitution font when viewed on a system that does not have the original fonts. The Fonts panel of the PDF Optimizer
contains two lists for fonts: fonts that are available for unembedding, and fonts to unembed. Certain fonts aren’t
available for unembedding and don’t appear in the Fonts panel. To unembed fonts in a document, select one or more
fonts in the Embedded Fonts list, and click the Unembed button. If you don’t want to embed subsets of the embedded
fonts, deselect Subset All Embedded Fonts. To prevent unembedding for all fonts in the document, select Do Not
Unembed Any Font.

Transparency panel
If your PDF includes artwork that contains transparency, you can use presets in the Transparency panel of PDF
Optimizer to flatten transparency and reduce file size. (Flattening incorporates transparency into corresponding
artwork by sectioning it into vector-based areas and rasterized areas.) PDF Optimizer applies transparency options to
all pages in the document before applying other optimization options.
If you select the Acrobat 4.0 And Later compatibility setting, the Transparency panel is enabled and all transparency
in the file is flattened during optimization. This ensures compatibility with Acrobat 4.0 and earlier, which doesn’t
support transparency.
When you create flattening presets, they appear with the default presets in the Transparency panel.
Note: Transparency flattening cannot be undone after the file is saved.

Discard Objects panel
The Discard Objects panel lets you specify objects to remove from the PDF and lets you optimize curved lines in CAD
drawings. You can discard objects created in Acrobat DC and in other applications. Selecting an object removes all
occurrences of that object within the PDF.
In the Discard Objects area, you can select from these and other options:
Discard All Form Submission, Import And Reset Actions Disables all actions related to submitting or importing form

data, and resets form fields. This option retains form objects to which actions are linked.

Last updated 5/10/2016

Editing PDFs

Flatten Form Fields Makes form fields unusable with no change to their appearance. Form data is merged with the page
to become page content.
Discard All JavaScript Actions Removes any actions in the PDF that use JavaScript.
Discard All Alternate Images Removes all versions of an image except the one destined for on-screen viewing. Some
PDFs include multiple versions of the same image for different purposes, such as low-resolution on-screen viewing and
high-resolution printing.
Discard Embedded Page Thumbnails Removes embedded page thumbnails. This is useful for large documents, which
can take a long time to draw page thumbnails after you click the Page Thumbnails button.
Discard Document Tags Removes tags from the document, which also removes the accessibility and reflow capabilities

for the text.
Convert Smooth Lines To Curves Reduces the number of control points used to build curves in CAD drawings, which

results in smaller PDF files and faster on-screen rendering.
Detect And Merge Image Fragments Looks for images or masks that are fragmented into thin slices and tries to merge

the slices into a single image or mask.
Discard Embedded Print Settings Removes embedded print settings, such as page scaling and duplex mode, from the

document.
Discard Embedded Search Index Removes embedded search indexes, which reduces the file size.
Discard Bookmarks Removes all bookmarks from the document.

Discard User Data panel
Use the Discard User Data panel to remove any personal information that you don’t want to distribute or share with
others. If you’re unable to find personal information, it may be hidden. You can locate hidden text and user-related
information by using the Examine Documentcommand (Tools &amp;gt; Redact &amp;gt; Remove Hidden Information).
Discard All Comments, Forms And Multimedia
Removes all comments, forms, form fields, and multimedia from the PDF.

Discard Document Information And Metadata
Removes information in the document information dictionary and all metadata streams. (Use the Save As command
to restore metadata streams to a copy of the PDF.)

Discard All Object Data
Removes all objects from the PDF.

Discard File Attachments
Removes all file attachments, including attachments added to the PDF as comments. (PDF Optimizer doesn’t optimize
attached files.)

Discard External Cross References
Removes links to other documents. Links that jump to other locations within the PDF are not removed.

Discard Private Data Of Other Applications
Strips information from a PDF document that is useful only to the application that created the document. This does
not affect the functionality of the PDF, but it does decrease the file size.

Discard Hidden Layer Content And Flatten Visible Layers
Decreases file size. The optimized document looks like the original PDF but doesn’t contain any layer information.

Clean Up panel
The options in the Clean Up panel of the PDF Optimizer dialog box allow you to remove useless items from the
document. These items include elements that are obsolete or unnecessary for your intended use of the document.
Removing certain elements can seriously affect the functionality of the PDF. By default, only elements that do not affect
functionality are selected. If you are unsure of the implications of removing other options, use the default selections.
Object Compression Options Specifies how to apply Flate compression in the file.
Use Flate To Encode Streams That Are Not Encoded Applies Flate compression to all streams that aren’t encoded.
In Streams That Use LZW Encoding, Use Flate Instead Applies Flate compression to all content streams and images that

use LZW encoding.
Discard Invalid Bookmarks Removes bookmarks that point to pages in the document that have been deleted.
Discard Invalid Links Removes links that jump to invalid destinations.
Discard Unreferenced Named Destinations Removes named destinations that are not being referenced internally from

within the PDF document. Because this option does not check for links from other PDF files or websites, it does not fit
in some workflows.
Optimize Page Content Converts all end-of-line characters to space characters, which improves Flate compression.
Optimize The PDF For Fast Web View Restructures a PDF document for page-at-a-time downloading (byte-serving)

from web servers.

Enable Fast Web View in a PDF
Fast Web View restructures a PDF document for page-at-a-time downloading (byte-serving) from web servers. With
Fast Web View, the web server sends only the requested page, rather than the entire PDF. This option is especially
important with large documents that can take a long time to download from a server.
Check with your webmaster to make sure that the web server software you use supports page-at-a-time downloading.
To ensure that the PDF documents on your website appear in older browsers, you can also create HTML links (versus
ASP scripts or the POST method) to the PDF documents and use relatively short path names (256 characters or fewer).

Verify that an existing PDF is enabled for Fast Web View
Open the PDF in Acrobat DC, and choose File &amp;gt; Properties. Look in the lower-right area of the Description panel
of the dialog box for the Fast Web View setting (Yes or No).

PDF properties and metadata
View document properties
When you view a PDF, you can get information about it, such as the title, the fonts used, and security settings. Some of
this information is set by the person who created the document, and some is generated automatically.
In Acrobat DC, you can change any information that can be set by the document creator, unless the file has been saved
with security settings that prevent changes.
1 Choose File &amp;gt; Properties.
2 Click a tab in the Document Properties dialog box.

Document Properties
Description Shows basic information about the document. The title, author, subject, and keywords may have been set
by the person who created the document in the source application, such as Word or InDesign, or by the person who
created the PDF. You can search for these description items to find particular documents. The Keywords section can
be particularly useful for narrowing searches.

Last updated 5/10/2016

Editing PDFs

Note that many search engines use the title to describe the document in their search results list. If a PDF does not have
a title, the filename appears in the results list instead. A file’s title is not necessarily the same as its filename.
The Advanced area shows the PDF version, the page size, number of pages, whether the document is tagged, and if it’s
enabled for Fast Web View. (The size of the first page is reported in PDFs or PDF Portfolios that contain multiple page
sizes.) This information is generated automatically and cannot be modified.
Security Describes what changes and functionality are allowed within the PDF. If a password, certificate, or security

policy has been applied to the PDF, the method is listed here.
Fonts Lists the fonts and the font types used in the original document, and the fonts, font types, and encoding used to
display the original fonts.

If substitute fonts are used and you aren’t satisfied with their appearance, you may want to install the original fonts on
your system or ask the document creator to re-create the document with the original fonts embedded in it.
Initial View (Acrobat only) Describes how the PDF appears when it’s opened. This includes the initial window size, the

opening page number and magnification level, and whether bookmarks, thumbnails, the toolbar, and the menu bar are
displayed. You can change any of these settings to control how the document appears the next time it is opened. You
can also create JavaScript that runs when a page is viewed, a document is opened, and more.
Custom (Acrobat only) Lets you add document properties to your document.
Advanced Lists PDF settings, print dialog presets, and reading options for the document.

In the PDF settings for Acrobat, you can set a base Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for web links in the document.
Specifying a base URL makes it easy for you to manage web links to other websites. If the URL to the other site changes,
you can simply edit the base URL and not have to edit each individual web link that refers to that site. The base URL is
not used if a link contains a complete URL address.
You can also associate a catalog index file (PDX) with the PDF. When the PDF is searched with the Search PDF window,
all of the PDFs that are indexed by the specified PDX file are also searched.
You can include prepress information, such as trapping, for the document. You can define print presets for a document,
which prepopulate the Print dialog box with document-specific values. You can also set reading options that determine
how the PDF is read by a screen reader or other assistive device.

Add a description to Document Properties
You can add keywords to the document properties of a PDF that other people might use in a search utility to locate the
PDF.
1 Choose File &amp;gt; Properties.
2 Click the Description tab, and type the author’s name, subject, and keywords.
3 (Optional) Click Additional Metadata to add other descriptive information, such as copyright information.

Create document properties
You can add custom document properties that store specific types of metadata, such as the version number or company
name, in a PDF. Properties you create appear in the Document Properties dialog box. Properties you create must have
unique names that do not appear in the other tabs in the Document Properties dialog box.
1 Choose File &amp;gt; Properties, and then select Custom.
2 To add a property, type the name and value, and then click Add.

• To delete a property, select it and click Delete.
To change the name of a custom property, delete the property and create a new custom property with the name you
want.

Edit document metadata
PDF documents created in Acrobat 5.0 or later contain document metadata in XML format. Metadata includes
information about the document and its contents, such as the author’s name, keywords, and copyright information, that
can be used by search utilities. The document metadata contains (but is not limited to) information that also appears
in the Description tab of the Document Properties dialog box. Document metadata can be extended and modified
using third-party products.
The Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP) provides Adobe applications with a common XML framework that
standardizes the creation, processing, and interchange of document metadata across publishing workflows. You can
save and import the document metadata XML source code in XMP format, making it easy to share metadata among
different documents. You can also save document metadata to a metadata template that you can reuse in Acrobat.

View document metadata
1 Choose File &amp;gt; Properties, and click the Additional Metadata button in the Description tab.
2 Click Advanced to display all the metadata embedded in the document. (Metadata is displayed by schema—that is,

in predefined groups of related information.) Display or hide the information in schemas by schema name. If a
schema doesn’t have a recognized name, it is listed as Unknown. The XML name space is contained in parentheses
after the schema name.

Edit or append document metadata
1 Choose File &amp;gt; Properties, click the Description tab, and then click Additional Metadata.
2 Select Advanced from the list on the left.
3 To edit the metadata, do any of the following, and then click OK.

• To add previously saved information, click Append, select an XMP or FFO file, and click Open.
• To add new information and replace the current metadata with information stored in an XMP file, click Replace,
select a saved XMP or FFO file, and click Open. New properties are added, existing properties that are also
specified in the new file are replaced, and existing properties that are not in the replacement file remain in the
metadata.
• To delete an XML schema, select it and click Delete.
• To append the current metadata with metadata from a template, hold down Ctrl (Windows) or Command (Mac
OS) and choose a template name from the dialog box menu in the upper right corner.
Note: You must save a metadata template before you can import metadata from a template.
To replace the current metadata with a template of metadata, choose a template file (XMP) from the dialog box
menu in the upper right corner.

Save metadata as a template or file
1 Choose File &amp;gt; Properties, click the Description tab, and then click Additional Metadata.
2 Select Advanced from the list on the left.

PDF layers
About PDF layers
You can view, navigate, and print layered content in PDFs created from applications such as InDesign, AutoCAD, and
Visio.
You can control the display of layers using the default and initial state settings. For example, you can hide a layer
containing a copyright notice whenever a document is displayed onscreen, while ensuring that the layer always prints.
In Acrobat Pro DC, you can rename, flatten, and merge layers, change the properties of layers, and add actions to layers.
You can also rearrange layers, import layers from image files and other PDFs, and lock layers to prevent them from
being hidden.
Acrobat Pro DC does not allow you to author layers that change visibility according to the zoom level. However, you
can highlight a portion of a layer that is especially important by creating a bookmark that magnifies or hides the layer
using page actions. You can also add links that let users click a visible or invisible link to navigate to or zoom in on a
layer.
To retain layers when you convert InDesign CS documents to PDF in Acrobat Pro DC, make sure that Compatibility
is set to Acrobat 6.0 (PDF 1.5) or higher. Additionally, make sure that Create Acrobat Layers is selected in the Export
Adobe PDF dialog box.

Show or hide layers
Information can be stored on different layers of a PDF. The layers that appear in the PDF are based on the layers created
in the original application. Use the Layers panel to examine layers and show or hide the content associated with each
layer. Items on locked layers cannot be hidden.
Some layers may be organized into nested groups with a parent layer. Other layers may be in groups with no parent
layer.
Note: A lock icon in the Layers panel indicates that a layer is for information only. Locked layers can be created from
AutoCAD and Visio files. In Acrobat Standard DC, the visibility of a locked layer cannot be changed. In Acrobat Pro DC,
use the Layer Properties dialog box to change the visibility of a locked layer.

is present, and hidden when the eye icon is absent. This setting temporarily overrides the settings in the Layer
Properties dialog box.)
Note: In a nested layer group, if the parent layer is hidden, the nested layers are automatically hidden as well. If the
parent layer is visible, nested layers can be made visible or hidden.
2 From the options menu

, choose one of the following:

List Layers For All Pages Shows every layer across every page of the document.
List Layers For Visible Pages Shows layers only on the currently visible pages.
Reset To Initial Visibility Resets layers to their default state.
Apply Print Overrides Displays layers according to the Print settings in the Layer Properties dialog box (Prints

When Visible, Never Prints, Always Prints).
Apply Export Overrides Displays layers according to the Export settings in the Layer Properties dialog box (Exports

When Visible, Never Exports, Always Exports).
Apply Layer Overrides Displays all layers. This option affects all optional content in the PDF, even layers that are

not listed in the Layers panel. All layers are visible, regardless of the settings in the Layer Properties dialog box. You
cannot change layer visibility using the eye icon until you deselect this command. When you edit layer properties in
the Layer Properties dialog box, changes are not effective until you choose Reset To Initial Visibility in the options
menu. (Changes to the layer name are the exception; they are effective immediately.)
Note: You cannot save the view of a layered PDF by using the eye icon in the Layers panel to show and hide layers. When
you save the file, the visibility of the layers automatically reverts to the initial visibility state.
To save a different view of a layered PDF in Acrobat Pro, you must change the default state of the layers in the Layer
Properties dialog box.

Edit layer properties (Acrobat Pro DC)
You can combine the default state setting, the visibility setting, and the print setting to control when a layer is visible
and when it prints. If a layer contains a watermark, for example, you may want the layer not to show onscreen but always
to print and always to export to other applications. In this case, you can set the default state to on, the initial visibility
to never visible (the image doesn’t show onscreen), and the initial print and initial export states to always print and
always export. The layer need not be listed in the Layers panel, since all the state changes are handled automatically.
Note: The settings in the Layer Properties dialog box take effect only if Allow Layer State To Be Set By User Information is
selected in the Documents preferences. If it is not selected, Layer Properties dialog box settings, other than Layer Name and
Default State, are ignored.
1 Click the Layers button in the navigation pane.
2 Select a layer, and choose Layer Properties from the options menu

.

3 In the Layer Properties dialog box, edit the layer name or any of the following properties, and then click OK:
Intent Select View to allow the layer to be turned on or off, or select Reference to keep the layer on at all times and

permit editing of the properties. When the Reference Intent option is selected, the layer appears in italics.
Default State Defines the initial visibility state of the layer when a document is first opened or when the initial

visibility is reset. The eye icons for layers are initially shown or hidden based on this value. For example, if this value
is set to off, the eye icon for a layer is hidden when the document is first opened or when Reset To Initial Visibility
is chosen from the options menu.

Visibility Defines the onscreen visibility of the PDF layer. You can show a layer when the document is opened, you
can hide a layer when the document is opened, or you can let the default state determine whether a layer is shown
or hidden when the document is opened.
Print Determines whether a layer will print.
Export Determines whether the layer appears in the resulting document when the PDF file is exported to an

application or file format that supports layers.
Any additional properties that the creator of the layered PDF has associated with a specific layer are shown in the
box at the bottom of the Layer Properties dialog box.

Reorder layers
You can reorder individual layers in the Layers pane. This action is useful if you want to change the order of layers in
the list, or move a layer from one layer group to another.
Note: You cannot reorder locked layers, and you cannot reorder layers in nested layer groups.
1 In the Layers navigation panel, select a layer.
2 Position the cursor to the left of the layer name, then hold down the Alt key while you drag the layer to the new

location.

Add layer navigation
You can add links and destinations to layers, allowing you to change the view of a document when the user clicks a
bookmark or link.
Note: In general, changes to layer visibility made using the eye icon in the Layers panel are not recorded in the Navigation
toolbar.

Create New Layer Creates a single, separate layer from the source document. Enter a name for the new layer.
Add To Group Specifies the existing layer group in which to add the imported layer. This option is available only

when the target PDF contains one or more existing layer groups, and when Create New Layer is selected.
Add To Existing Layer Adds the content from the source document to an existing layer in the target document.

Select a layer from your target document. The imported content will have the same layer properties as the existing
layer in the target document. This option is available only when the target document contains layers.
Copy Layers From Source Imports the layers from the source document. This option is available only when the
source document contains layers.

5 Adjust the Position and Appearance settings as needed, and then click OK.

Merge or flatten layers (Acrobat Pro DC)
Merged layers acquire the properties of the layer into which they are merged (the target layer). Flattening PDF layers
hides any content that is not visible when the flattening operation is executed and consolidates all layers.
Note: You cannot undo either a merging or a flattening operation.

Merge layers
1 Click the Layers button, and select Merge Layers from the options menu

.

2 In the Layers To Be Merged pane, select one or more layers, and click Add.

Editing layered content
You can select or copy content in a layered PDF document using the Select tool or the Snapshot tool. (In Acrobat Reader
DC, the PDF must include usage rights.) In Acrobat DC, you can edit content using Edit Text &amp; Images tool. These tools
recognize and select any content that is visible, regardless of whether the content is on a selected layer.
In Acrobat DC, if the content that you edit or delete is associated with one layer, the content of the layer reflects the
change. If the content that you edit or delete is associated with more than one layer, the content in all the layers reflects
the change. For example, if you want to change a title and byline that appear on the same line on the first page of a
document, and the title and byline are on two different visible layers, editing the content on one layer changes the
content on both layers.
You can add content, such as review comments, stamps, or form fields, to layered documents just as you would to any
other PDF document. However, the content is not added to a specific layer, even if that layer is selected when the
content is added. Rather, the content is added to the entire document.
In Acrobat DC, you can use the Merge Files Into A Single PDF command to combine PDF documents that contain
layers. The layers for each document are grouped under a separate heading in the Layers panel of the navigation pane.
You expand and collapse the group by clicking the icon in the title bar for the group.

Page thumbnails and bookmarks in PDFs
About page thumbnails
Page thumbnails are miniature previews of the pages in a document. You can use page thumbnails to jump quickly to a
selected page or to adjust the view of the page. When you move, copy, or delete a page thumbnail, you move, copy, or
delete the corresponding page.
If you do not see page thumbnails in the navigation pane, try using F4 to open the navigation pane. Or choose View &amp;gt;
Show/Hide &amp;gt; Navigation Panes &amp;gt; Page Thumbnails.

Create page thumbnails
Page thumbnails increase file size, so Acrobat does not create them automatically.
Note: Acrobat no longer supports embedding and unembedding page thumbnails. However, Acrobat Distiller® provides an
alternate method of embedding page thumbnails.

Create page thumbnails
Click the Page Thumbnails button on the left.
Page thumbnails appear in the navigation pane. This process may require several seconds, particularly in larger
documents. The drawing of page thumbnails may pause if you interact with the application during this process.

Define the tabbing order
In the Page Thumbnails panel, you can set the order in which a user tabs through form fields, links, and comments for
each page.
1 Click the Page Thumbnails button on the left.
2 Select a page thumbnail, and choose Page Properties from the options menu

.

3 In the Page Properties dialog box, click Tab Order, and select the tab order:
Use Row Order Moves through rows from left to right, or right to left for pages with a right-to-left binding.
Use Column Order Moves through columns from left to right and from top to bottom, or right to left for pages with

a right-to-left binding.
Use Document Structure Moves in the order specified by the authoring application.

Note: For structured documents—PDFs that were created from desktop publishing applications or that contain tags—
it’s best to select the Use Document Structure option to match the intention of the authoring application.
If the document was created in an earlier version of Acrobat, the tab order is Unspecified by default. With this
setting, form fields are tabbed through first, followed by links and then comments ordered by row.

About bookmarks
A bookmark is a type of link with representative text in the Bookmarks panel in the navigation pane. Each bookmark
goes to a different view or page in the document. Bookmarks are generated automatically during PDF creation from
the table-of-contents entries of documents created by most desktop publishing programs. These bookmarks are often
tagged and can be used to make edits in the PDF.
Initially, a bookmark displays the page that was in view when the bookmark was created, which is the bookmark’s
destination. In Acrobat, you can set bookmark destinations as you create each bookmark. However, it is sometimes
easier to create a group of bookmarks, and then set the destinations later.
In Acrobat, you can use bookmarks to mark a place in the PDF to which you want to return, or to jump to a destination
in the PDF, another document, or a web page. Bookmarks can also perform actions, such as executing a menu item or
submitting a form.
Note: An Acrobat user can add bookmarks to a document only if the security settings allow it.

Add tagged bookmarks
Tagged bookmarks give you greater control over page content than do regular bookmarks. Because tagged bookmarks
use the underlying structural information of the document elements (for example, heading levels, paragraphs, table
titles), you can use them to edit the document, such as rearranging their corresponding pages in the PDF or deleting
pages. If you move or delete a parent tagged bookmark, its children tagged bookmarks are moved or deleted along with
it.
Many desktop publishing applications, such as Adobe InDesign® and Microsoft Word, create structured documents.
When you convert these documents to PDF, the structure is converted to tags, which support the addition of tagged
bookmarks. Converted web pages typically include tagged bookmarks.
If your document doesn’t include tags, you can always add them in Acrobat.
1 In the Bookmarks panel, choose New Bookmarks From Structure from the options menu

. (If this option isn’t

available, the document isn’t structured.)
2 Select the structure elements you want specified as tagged bookmarks. Ctrl-click to add to the selection.

Action Wizard (Acrobat Pro DC)
About actions
When you apply one or more routine sets of commands to your files, you can save time and keystrokes by using an
action—a defined series of commands with specific settings and in a specific order that you apply in a single step. You
can apply an action to a single document, to several documents, or to an entire collection of documents. You can even
scan documents and combine several documents into a single PDF before running an action.
Acrobat DC provides some predefined actions. You can also create your own actions. You can access and manage the
actions by clicking Tools &amp;gt; Action Wizard.
Adobe Acrobat DC also lets you export and import actions and commands so that you can share them with others.
Note: The actions interface and architecture replace the batch script mode available in the earlier versions of Acrobat. Most
of your Acrobat XI batch scripts can be imported as actions; some scripts require minor changes.

Run an action
Acrobat DC includes several simple predefined actions that you can use to streamline your work. These actions
represent common tasks that you routinely perform to prepare files for distribution. You do not have to open any of the
PDF files before you begin to run these actions.
Note: You can avoid password prompts when you run a sequence on PDFs that require passwords. Automate password
entry, or specify a security method for these files in the Action Wizard panel of the Preferences dialog box. If you select Do
Not Ask For Password, PDFs that require passwords are not processed.
1 Choose Tools &amp;gt; Action Wizard. A list of available actions is displayed under the Actions List in the right hand pane.
2 Choose the action from the list. The right-hand pane changes to display each task included in the action, as well as

any instructions provided by the author of the action.
3 Under Files To Be Processed, clickAdd Filesto select the files that you want to run the action on. You can run the

action on the currently opened file, or add more files, folders, or email attachments.
4 When all the files you want to process are listed, click Start.
5 If Acrobat prompts you, provide additional information, such as output location and settings.

A progress indicator displays the status of the currently running process or task. A check mark identifies completed
actions or tasks. On successful completion of all tasks, “Completed” status is shown in the panel.

PDFs converted to web pages
Links and bookmarks in web pages
You can work with a PDF document created from web pages the same way you work with any other PDF. Depending
on how you configured Acrobat, clicking a link on a converted web page adds the page for that link to the end of the
PDF, if it isn’t already included.
Note: Remember that one web page can become multiple PDF pages. A web page is a single topic (or URL) from a website
and is often one continuous HTML page. When you convert a web page to PDF, it may be divided into multiple standardsize PDF pages.
When you first create a PDF from web pages, tagged bookmarks are generated if Create Bookmarks is selected in the
Web PageConversion Settings dialog box. A standard (untagged) bookmark representing the web server appears at the
top of the Bookmarks tab. Under that bookmark is a tagged bookmark for each web page downloaded; the tagged
bookmark’s name comes from the page’s HTML title or the URL, if no title is present. Tagged web bookmarks are
initially all at the same level, but you can rearrange them and nest them in family groups to help keep track of the
hierarchy of material on the web pages.
If Create PDF Tags is selected when you create a PDF from web pages, structure information that corresponds to the
HTML structure of the original pages is stored in the PDF. You can use this information to add tagged bookmarks to
the file for paragraphs and other items that have HTML elements.

Setting up PDFs for a presentation
Defining initial view as Full Screen mode
Full Screen mode is a property you can set for PDFs used for presentations. In Full Screen mode, PDF pages fill the
entire screen, and the Acrobat menu bar, toolbar, and window controls are hidden. You can also set other opening
views, so that your documents or collections of documents open to a consistent view. In either case, you can add page
transitions to enhance the visual effect as the viewer pages through the document.
To control how you navigate a PDF (for example, advancing pages automatically), use the options in the Full Screen
panel of the Preferences dialog box. These preferences are specific to a system—not a PDF document—and affect all
PDFs that you open on that system. Therefore, if you set up your presentation on a system you control, you can control
these preferences.

Define an initial view
When a user opens your PDF document or PDF Portfolio, they see the initial view of the PDF. You can set the initial
view to the magnification level, page, and page layout that you want. If your PDF is a presentation, you can set the initial
view to Full Screen mode. In Acrobat Pro you can create Action Wizards to change default settings for multiple
documents.
After you define the initial view of the PDF, you can add page transitions to selected pages or the entire document.
Acrobat supports page transitions and bullet fly-ins from PowerPoint.

About articles
Many traditional print documents, such as magazines and newspapers, arrange text in multiple columns. Stories flow
from column to column and sometimes across several pages. While the format is effective for printed material, this type
of structure can be difficult to follow on-screen because of the scrolling and zooming required.
The article feature enables you to guide readers through material presented in multiple columns and across a series of
pages.

Define articles
You create an article by defining a series of boxes around the content in the order in which you want the content read.
The navigational path you define for an article is known as the article thread. You create a thread connecting the various
boxes, unifying them into a continuous text flow.
Most desktop publishing programs allow you to generate article threads automatically as you convert the files to Adobe
PDF. If the file you’re viewing has articles, you can show the names of the articles on a tab and navigate easily through
them.
1 Choose Tools &amp;gt; Edit PDF &amp;gt; More &amp;gt; Add Article Box. The pointer appears as a cross-hair pointer in the document

window.
2 Drag a rectangle to define the first article box. An article box appears around the enclosed text, and the pointer

changes to the article pointer.
Each article box you create has a label that consists of the article number and its sequence within the article. For
example, the first box for the first article is labeled 1-1, the second box 1-2, and so on. The boxes for the second
article in the same document are labeled 2-1, 2-2, 2-3, and so on.
3 Go to the next part of the document you want to include in the article, and draw a rectangle around that text. Repeat

until you have defined the entire article.
Note: To resize or move an article box, you must first end the article.
4 To end the article, press Enter.
5 In the Article Properties dialog box, enter the article title, subject, author, and any keywords to describe the article,

and click OK.

Geospatial PDFs
About geospatial PDFs
A geospatial PDF contains information that is required to georeference location data. When geospatial data is imported
into a PDF, Acrobat DC retains the geospatial coordinates. With the coordinates, you can view and interact with the
PDF to find and mark location data.
Geospatial data can be either vector or raster based or a combination of both. After you import geospatial data into
Acrobat DC, you can use the data in a variety of ways:

• Find and mark location coordinates.
• Measure distance, perimeter, and area.
• Change the coordinate system and measurement units.
• Copy location coordinates to the clipboard, and then use them to show locations in several web mapping services.

Create geospatial PDFs
You can create a geospatial PDF in one of these ways:

• Opening a geospatially enabled TIFF (GeoTIFF) or JPEG 2000 file
• Georegistering a PDF map or scan of geospatial data

Last updated 5/10/2016

Editing PDFs

When you open an imported file, measurements, point position, and length are displayed in geographic coordinates,
which you can change, measure, and mark up. You can also assemble a PDF map from a variety of sources.

Open GeoTIFF and JPEG 2000 files
GeoTIFF files and JPEG 2000 files are raster images that you can import as new documents or as new layers to an
existing document. Acrobat DC preserves the geospatial coordinates embedded in the file. These files retain their
geospatial data when they are imported. If you import these files to existing documents, their coordinate system is
converted to the coordinate system of the document.
1 Choose File &amp;gt; Create &amp;gt; PDF From File.
2 Select the geospatially enabled file to import.
3 Select settings, and then click OK.

Import shapefiles
You can import a shapefile as a new layer to an existing PDF. The shapefile must overlap with the current PDF map.
Otherwise, it is not imported. If it overlaps only partially, only the part that overlaps the current PDF is imported.
A shapefile consists of several files with differing filename extensions. Acrobat requires both the SHP file and the DBF
file for importing.
1 Open a PDF map, and choose View &amp;gt; Show/Hide &amp;gt; Navigation Panes &amp;gt; Layers.
2 Select Option on the Layer sidebar and click Import As Layer.
3 Browse to the SHP file and select it.
4 Click Settings and change the Line Properties to a solid line and the line color to blue.

Interact with geospatial PDFs
When you open a geospatially enabled PDF, you can find locations, measure distances, and add location markers. You
can also copy coordinates to the clipboard for use with a web mapping service.
View the geospatial measuring tools by choosing Tools &amp;gt; Measure.
Use the Geospatial Location tool to perform these tasks:

• View latitude and longitude while the cursor is over an area containing geospatial information.
• Mark a location with a geospatial annotation.
• Search for a location in a document.

Find map locations
1 Open a geospatial PDF and choose Tools &amp;gt; Measure &amp;gt; Geospatial Location tool.
2 Right-click inside the map, and then click Find A Location.
3 Type the latitude and longitude values (degrees, minutes, seconds, or decimal) in the two text boxes, and click Find.

If at least one location is available, the location is highlighted with a blue square and the page is centered on the
highlighted location.

4 If the PDF includes more than one map, click the Next or Previous button to view additional results, if any. Multiple

locations are available in several situations:

• When a document contains multiple maps (for example, if a PDF contains a smaller map within a larger map,
such as a city within a map of a state or country). When you search for a location within the city, Acrobat DC
finds it in both the larger map and the city map.
• When a document contains multiple pages of a map (for example, if page one is a map of a country and page two
is a map of a state or city within the country).
5 (Optional) To add a comment (such as a place name or address), click the location marker, and then add the

information in the comment box.
6 To end the search, right-click inside the map. Then select Hide Location Search, to remove the search boxes.

Mark geospatial locations
1 Open a geospatial PDF and choose Tools &amp;gt; Measure &amp;gt; Geospatial Location Tool.
2 Move the mouse pointer over the document to view latitude and longitude values of areas that contain geospatial

information. Right-click inside the map, and then do one of the following:

• To find a location, click Find A Location. Type the latitude and longitude values, and click Find.
• To mark a location with geospatial information, click Mark Location.
3 (Optional) To add a comment (such as a place name or address), click the location marker, and then add the

information in the comment box.

Measure distance, perimeter, and area on maps
When you open a geospatial PDF, the Acrobat measuring tools read the geospatial information and measure distance
and area instead of page or object dimensions. Use the measurement tools to calculate distance, perimeter, and area on
any geospatially enabled PDF. As you move the mouse pointer over content in the document, snap markers are shown
that indicate that you are on a path or path end point. You can also see the latitude and longitude of your cursor location
when the mouse pointer is over geospatial content.
1 Choose Tools &amp;gt; Measure &amp;gt; Measuring Tool.
2 In the Measurement Tool display, select a measurement type: Distance

, Area

, or Perimeter

.

3 Select a snap-to option:

• Snap to paths
• Snap to end points
• Snap to midpoints
• Snap to intersections
4 Do one of the following:

• If you are using the Distance tool, click where you want to start the measurement, and then drag to the end point
and click again. The distance is displayed in the lower-right corner.
• If you are using the Perimeter tool, click the map in one corner of the perimeter, and then drag to each corner.
Click at each corner and then double-click at the end point. The information window displays the perimeter size.
• If you are using the Area tool, click the map at one corner of the area, and then drag to another corner. Click
before changing directions. Double-click at the end to display the total area.
5 To finish the measurement, right-click and select Complete Measurement. Or, select Cancel Measurement.

the Latitude, and an E (east) and W (west) for Longitude.
Always Display Latitude And Longitude As WGS 1984 Select to ensure that latitude and longitude use the current

standard reference frame for earth (World Geodetic System 1984). For older maps that were drawn with an earlier grid
(such as NAD 1927), you can deselect this option to see the original values. When an older map is registered in its native
coordinates, coordinate positions can be different from current standards used in GPS devices and web mapping
services.
Use Default Distance Unit Select the measurement unit to use.
Use Default Area Unit Area can be measured using a different unit from distance.
Don’t Show Transparency Layer In GeoTIFF And JPEG 2000 Images Raster image formats include a transparency layer

that you can choose to remove.

Export location and measurement markups
You can export geospatial location and measurement data to an FDF file. Each geospatial annotation has a GPTS entry.
The entry corresponds to the latitude and longitude for each of the annotation points. The types of information that
can be exported include the following:

• Marked locations entered by using the Geospatial Location tool
• Distance, perimeter (compound distance), and area measurements entered by using the Measurement tool over
geospatial content

Applying actions and scripts to PDFs
About actions
You can cause an action to occur when a bookmark or link is clicked, or when a page is viewed. For example, you can
use links and bookmarks to jump to different locations in a document, execute commands from a menu, and perform
other actions. Actions are set in the Properties dialog box.
For bookmarks or links, you specify an action that occurs when the bookmark or link is clicked. For other items, such
as pages, media clips and form fields, you define a trigger that causes the action to occur and then define the action
itself. You can add multiple actions to one trigger.
The Locked option prevents the appearance and actions associated with an object from being accidentally changed.

Add an action to bookmarks, form fields, buttons, or clips
1 Do one of the following:

• Using the Hand tool, right-click the bookmark, and choose Properties.
• Using the Tools &amp;gt; Rich Media &amp;gt; Select Object tool, double-click the link, media clip, or form field, and choose
Properties.
2 Click the Actions tab.
3 From the Select Action menu, select the action type to occur, and then click Add. You can add multiple actions;

actions execute in the order that they appear in the Actions list box.
4 (Optional) Select an action in the Actions tab, and use the buttons to reorder, edit, or delete the action.
5 Close the window to accept the actions.

set an action when the page closes.
5 Choose an action from the Select Action menu, and click Add.
6 Specify the options for the action, and click OK. The options available depend on the action selected.
7 To create a series of actions, choose another action from the menu, and click Add again. Use the Up and Down

buttons to arrange the actions in the order you want them to occur.
Note: If you set an action that switches to Full Screen view on Page Open or Page Close, the next time the same page
opens or closes, Full Screen view is turned on.

Action types
You can assign the following actions to links, bookmarks, pages, media clips, and form fields:
Execute A Menu Item Executes a specified menu command as the action.
Go To A 3D/Multimedia View Jumps to the specified 3D view.
Go To A Page View Jumps to the specified destination in the current document or in another document.
Import Form Data Brings in form data from another file, and places it in the active form.
Multimedia Operation (Acrobat 9 And Later) Executes a specified action for a multimedia object in the file (such as

playing a sound file). The multimedia object must be added to the file before you can specify an action for it.
Open A File Launches and opens a file. If you are distributing a PDF file with a link to another file, the reader needs the

native application of that linked file to open it successfully. (You may need to add opening preferences for the target
file.)
Open A Web Link Jumps to the specified destination on the Internet. You can use http, ftp, and mailto protocols to

define your link.
Play A Sound Plays the specified sound file. The sound is embedded into the PDF document in a cross-platform

format.
Play Media (Acrobat 5 Compatible) Plays the specified QuickTime or AVI movie that was created as Acrobat 5-

compatible. The specified movie must be embedded in a PDF document.
Play Media (Acrobat 6 And Later Compatible) Plays a specified movie that was created as Acrobat 6-compatible. The
specified movie must be embedded in a PDF document.
Read An Article Follows an article thread in the active document or in another PDF document.
Reset A Form Clears previously entered data in a form. You can control the fields that are reset with the Select Fields

dialog box.
Run A JavaScript Runs the specified JavaScript.
Set Layer Visibility Determines which layer settings are active. Before you add this action, specify the appropriate layer

settings.
Show/Hide A Field Toggles between showing and hiding a field in a PDF document. This option is especially useful in

form fields. For example, if you want an object to pop up whenever the pointer is over a button, you can set an action
that shows a field on the Mouse Enter trigger and hides a field on Mouse Exit.
Submit A Form Sends the form data to the specified URL.

Trigger types
Triggers determine how actions are activated in media clips, pages, and form fields. For example, you can specify a
movie or sound clip to play when a page is opened or closed. The available options depend on the specified page
element.
You can use the following triggers for media clips and form fields (not links or bookmarks):
Mouse Up (Acrobat Pro DC) When the mouse button is released after a click. This is the most common button trigger,

because it gives the user one last chance to drag the pointer off the button and not activate the action.
Page Visible (media clips only) When the page containing the media clip is visible, regardless of whether it is the
current page. It’s possible for a page to be visible without being the current page, such as when a continuous page layout
displays pages side-by-side.
Page Invisible (media clips only) When the page containing the media clip is moved out of view.
Page Enter (media clips only) When the page containing the media clip becomes the current page.
Page Exit (media clips only) When a user leaves the page that contains the media clip.
Mouse Down When the mouse button is clicked (without being released). In most cases, Mouse Up is the preferred

trigger.
Mouse Enter When the pointer enters the field or play area.
Mouse Exit When the pointer exits the field or play area.
On Receive Focus (media clips only) When the link area receives focus, either through a mouse action or tabbing.
On Lose Focus (media clips only) When the focus moves to a different link area.

About JavaScript in Acrobat
The JavaScript language was developed by Netscape Communications as a means to create interactive web pages more
easily. Adobe has enhanced JavaScript so that you can easily integrate this level of interactivity into your PDF
documents.
You can invoke JavaScript code using actions associated with bookmarks, links, and pages. The Set Document Actions
command lets you create document-level JavaScript actions that apply to the entire document. For example, selecting
Document Did Save runs the JavaScript after a document is saved.
Acrobat Pro DC is required to use JavaScript with forms and action wizards.
In Acrobat Pro DC, you can also use JavaScript with PDF forms and action wizard. The most common uses for
JavaScript in forms are formatting data, calculating data, validating data, and assigning an action. Field-level scripts are
associated with a specific form field or fields, such as a button. This type of script is executed when an event occurs,
such as a Mouse Up action.
To learn how to create JavaScript scripts, download the JavaScript manuals from the Adobe website. Developing
Acrobat®Applications Using JavaScript™ contains background information and tutorials, and the JavaScript™ for
Acrobat®API Reference contains detailed reference information. These and other JavaScript resources are located on the
Adobe website.

form out to be filled in and signed using Adobe Sign. Not all fields convert to eSign fields, such as List Box, Dropdown,
or Button fields. You can add additional eSign fields from the toolbar.
1 Open the PDF you want to convert to an eSign form.
2 Choose Tools &amp;gt; Prepare Form.
3 Click Start.

Acrobat DC creates the form and opens it in the Form Editing mode. The right hand pane displays options for
editing the form. The toolbar contains form field tools for adding additional fields.
4 In the right hand pane, click More and then choose Convert To eSign Form.
5 When alerted that Acrobat DC removes form fields that eSign doesn't support, click Next, and then in the

subsequent alert, click OK.
6 To add a field to the form, select its icon in the toolbar. Position the pointer where you want to place the field, and

click to insert it.

Enable Reader users to save form data
Ordinarily, users of Reader X and earlier can’t save filled-in copies of forms that they complete. However, you can
extend the rights of a PDF to allow these users to save form data. If you have Acrobat Pro DC, you can include
additional capabilities for Reader users, such as adding text to non-interactive forms.
Note: Unlike earlier versions of Reader, Reader XI and Acrobat Reader DC include both the Add Text tool and the ability
to save form data. Acrobat DC users can type in non-fillable forms, add comments, and digitally sign PDFs without
extending special rights.
1 Open a single PDF, or preview a component PDF in a PDF Portfolio.
2 If you are editing the form, click the cross icon next to the Preview button in the upper-right corner.
3 Choose File &amp;gt; Save As Other &amp;gt; Reader Extended PDF, and choose one of the following options:
Enable Commenting &amp; Measuring (Acrobat Pro DC) Allows users to add comments or access the Object Data,

Measuring, and Geospatial tools.
Enable More Tools (includes form fill-in &amp; save) Lets users save data they’ve entered in interactive or fillable forms.

For troubleshooting tips on Reader-enabling forms, see this Techical Note .

Notes on saving filled-in forms locally
Both Acrobat Standard DC and Acrobat Pro DC allow Adobe Reader 8 or later users to fill in and save PDF forms
locally. Note the following two points about the use of the Reader Extensions capability for local saving of PDF forms
(called extended documents):
Number of deployed extended documents An Acrobat Standard DC or Acrobat Pro DC customer can send an

extended document to an unlimited number of recipients for them to fill in. For example, an Acrobat customer can post
an empty form template on a web page that allows users to fill in and save PDF forms locally. An unlimited number of

people can access the template. Also, the Acrobat customer can collect unlimited number of responses from the filledin form.
Number of recipients of the extended document An Acrobat Standard DC or Acrobat Pro DC customer can send an
extended document to unlimited number of recipients. The Acrobat customer can send unlimited number of copies of
the extended document to unlimited number of recipients and collect unlimited number of responses from the filledin form.

Adding JavaScript to forms
The JavaScript language lets you create interactive web pages. Adobe has enhanced JavaScript so that you can easily
integrate interactivity into PDF forms. The most common uses for JavaScript in Acrobat forms are formatting,
calculating, validating data, and assigning an action. In Windows, you can also configure Adobe PDF forms to connect
directly to databases using Open Database Connection (ODBC).
Note: If you’re creating dynamic forms, keep in mind that Acrobat Reader doesn’t support some custom JavaScripts. The
form may not function properly when viewed in Acrobat Reader unless additional usage rights are added to the PDF.

Is the form fillable?
Not all forms are fillable. Sometimes form creators don’t convert their PDFs to interactive fillable forms. Or, they
intentionally design a form that you can fill in only by hand or with the Fill &amp; Sign tool. These non-interactive forms
are called flat forms.

Fill in interactive forms
An interactive form contains fields that you can select or fill in.

A Purple message bar indicates presence of fillable fields. B When clicked, shows where fillable fields exist.

1 If necessary, right-click the document, and select either the Hand Tool or the Select Tool from the pop-up menu.

The pointer changes to a different icon as you move it over a field. For example, the Hand
tool changes to an Ibeam when you can type text into the form field. Some text fields are dynamic, meaning that they automatically
resize to accommodate the amount of data you enter and can span across pages.
2 (Optional) To make form fields easier to identify, click the Highlight Existing Fields button

on the

document message bar. Form fields appear with a colored background (light blue by default), and all required form
fields are outlined in another color (red by default).
3 Click to select options, such as radio buttons. Click inside a text field to type.

Press Tab to move forward or Shift+Tab to move backward.
4 When finished, click the submit button to either send the data to a server or create an email to send the data. The

submit button can appear in the purple message bar at the top of the form or in the form content.

About form field properties
How a form field behaves is determined by settings in the Properties dialog box for that individual field. You can set
properties that apply formatting, determine how the form field information relates to other form fields, impose
limitations on what the user can enter in the form field, trigger custom scripts, and so on.
You can set various properties for an Acrobat DC form field, depending on the form field type. The properties for each
type of form field are selected on a series of tabs. When you change a property, it is applied as soon as you select another
property or press Enter.
All types of form fields have a General tab and an Actions tab. Other tabs appear only in specific types of form fields.
The Options tab appears for most form field types but the options available are unique to each type of form field.
Two items are available on every tab. If you select one on any tab, a check mark will appear, and the option will be
checked on all tabs. These are:
Locked

Properties dialog box open. Click each field to change its properties.
Note: If you select Locked on any tab, it locks all options for the field, not just the options on that tab.

Modify form field properties
You can access form field properties only when you are in editing mode. You can change the properties for multiple
form fields at a time.
1 If you are not in form editing mode, choose Tools &amp;gt; Prepare Form.
2 Open the Properties dialog box using one of the following methods:

• To edit a single form field, double-click it or right-click it and choose Properties.
• To edit multiple form fields, select the fields that you want to edit, right-click one of the selected fields, and
choose Properties.
3 Change the properties on each of the available tabs, as needed.

The property is changed as soon as you select another property or press Enter.
4 Click Close.

If you select form fields that have different property values, some options in the Properties dialog box are not available.
Otherwise, changes to the available options are applied to all selected form fields.
To avoid accidental changes to the form field, select Locked in the lower-left corner of the Properties dialog box before
you close it. To unlock, click the option again.

General tab for form field properties
The General tab appears for all types of form fields and includes the following options:
Name Specifies the unique name of the selected form field.
Tooltip Displays text that the hesitant user may find helpful in filling in the form field. Tooltips appear when the pointer
hovers briefly over the form field.
Form Field Specifies whether the form field can be seen, either on screen or in print. The choices are: Visible, Hidden,

Visible But Doesn’t Print, and Hidden But Printable.
Orientation Rotates the form field by 0, 90, 180, or 270 Degrees
Read Only Prevents the user from changing the form field content.
Required Forces the user to fill in the selected form field. If the user attempts to submit the form while a required field
is blank, an error message appears and the empty required form field is highlighted.

Appearance tab for form field properties
Appearance properties determine how the form field looks on the page. The Appearance tab appears for all types of
form fields except barcodes, and includes the following options:
Border Color Opens a color picker in which you can select a color swatch for the frame surrounding the field. To leave
the field without a frame, select No Color.

Forms

Line Thickness Specifies the width of the frame surrounding the form field: Thin, Medium, or Thick.
Fill Color Opens a color picker in which you can select a color swatch for the background behind the field. To leave the

field uncolored, select No Color.
note: A Fill Color choice other than No Color will block any images on the PDF page that are behind the form field.
Line Style Alters the appearance of the frame. Select Solid, Dashed, Beveled, Inset, or Underline.
Font Size Sets the size of user-entered text or of the selection marker for radio buttons and check boxes. The choices
include Auto, various preset values, and typing in a different value. If you select Auto for a text field, as the user types,
the font size changes to fit the text in the box.
Text Color Opens a color picker in which you can select a color swatch for the text or selection marker.
Font Lists the fonts available on your computer. This option is not available for form fields that do not display text.

Note: The Enable Right-To-Left Language Options in the Language panel of the Preferences dialog box affects what appears
in the Appearance tab of the Properties dialog box. When that preference is selected, the Appearance tab includes options
for changing the digit style and text direction for text fields, drop-down list boxes, and list boxes.

Position tab for form field properties
The Position tab lets you position or size the currently selected field or fields. You can move fields to the location you
specify on the page. Use the Height and Width options to change only the size of fields. To move fields without resizing
them, choose Do Not Change Height And Width When Changing The Position.

Options tab for form field properties
The options available on this tab change according to the type of form field selected. The Options tab appears for all
form field types except digital signatures.

Barcode
The Options tab for barcode field properties contains the following:
Symbology Includes the PDF417, QR Code, and Data Matrix barcode types.

note: If your organization processes forms by multiple methods, select the method that accommodates the lowest quality
barcode images. For example, if forms will be returned by fax and mail, choose Fax Server as the decode condition to ensure
high read rates on all forms.
Compress Data Before Encoding To Barcode Specifies that data will be compressed before it is encoded. Data is
compressed with the Flat compression method. Compressed data usually requires less storage space in the barcode,
allowing more data to be stored. In general, select this option if you will use the Acrobat barcode forms decoder to
interpret the returned data. Do not select this option if you will use a handheld barcode scanner, because most of these
cannot decode compressed data.
Decode Condition The preset decode conditions represent recommended starting points that you can adjust by
clicking the Custom button.
Custom Opens a dialog box in which you can select custom processing parameters that are best for your specific

scanning and faxing hardware. (The available options vary according to barcode types.)
X Dimension Width, in mils (1 mil = 0.001 inch or 0.0254mm), of the cell.
Y/X Ratio Height/width ratio of the cell. For example, for a data cell that is twice as high as it is wide, enter 2. (Available

only for PDF417 barcodes.)

Last updated 5/10/2016

211
Forms

note: If you are planning to decode the barcode using a handheld laser scanner, avoid creating barcodes wider than 4 inches
(10.2 cm). Taller and narrower barcodes generally work better with handheld scanners. Barcode height and width will not
be an issue if you are using an Adobe barcode decoder (available separately).
Error Correction Level Corresponds to the level of data redundancy that is added to the barcode to correct any potential

decoding errors. Higher levels provide more redundancy and a more robust barcode that will generate more successful
decode results. However, higher levels will also result in a larger barcode and a reduced ability to encode user-supplied
or form structure data into the barcode. A more robust barcode can reduce problems created by pen marks, poor print
quality, degradation caused by fax transmission, or folds in the document. This option is available for PDF417 and QR
Code barcodes.
Manage Barcode Parameters Enables you to save your custom barcode selections in a file. You can then export the file

and make it available to other form authors in your organization.

Check boxes
Check Box Style Specifies the shape of the marker that appears inside the check box when the user selects it: Check (the

default), Circle, Cross, Diamond, Square, or Star. This property does not alter the shape of the check box itself.
Note: The size of the marker inside the check box is determined by the size of the font you specify in the Appearance
tab.
Export Value Specifies a value to represent the item if the data will be exported. If left blank, the entry for Name in the

General tab is used as the export value.
Check Box Is Checked By Default Shows the check box selected unless the user deselects it.

Drop-down and list box
For either dropdown boxes or list boxes, you use the Options tab to create a list of items from which the user selects.
Although most of the properties on this tab are common to both these types of form fields, a few are exclusive to one
type or the other.
Item Accepts the text that you type for options that you want to appear in the menu for the field.
Add Moves the current entry in Item to the Item List.
Export Value Where you type in a value to represent the item if the data will be exported. If left blank, the entry for

Name in the General tab is used as the export value.
Item List Displays the choices that will be available in the list.

note: The highlighted item in the Item List box appears as the default selected item in the dropdown box or list box field.
To change the default item, highlight another item from the list.
Up and Down buttons Change the order in which the items are listed in the drop-down list. These buttons are not

available if Sort Items is selected.
Delete Removes the selected item from the list.
Sort Items Arranges the listed items numerically and alphabetically. A numerical sort (if applicable) is performed

before an alphabetical sort.
Allow User To Enter Custom Text (Dropdown only) Enables users to enter a value other than the ones in the list.
Check Spelling (Dropdown only) Checks the spelling of user-entered text. This option is applicable only if Allow User

To Enter Custom Text is selected.
Multiple Selection (List boxes only) Enables users to choose more than one item in the list.

Commit Selected Value Immediately Saves the value as soon as the user selects it. If this option is not selected, the value
is saved only when the user tabs out of the current field or clicks another form field. For list boxes only, this option is
not available if Multiple Selection is selected.

Radio buttons
Create a group of radio buttons if you want the user to select only one choice among a set of choices. All the radio
buttons in a group have the same Name, but each button has a different Button Value.
Button Style Specifies the shape of the marker that appears inside the button when the user selects it: Check, Circle (the

default), Cross, Diamond, Square, or Star. This property does not alter the shape of the radio button itself.
Radio Button Choice Identifies the radio button and differentiates it from other radio buttons that have the same Name

value.
Button Is Checked By Default Sets the selection state of the button when the user first opens the form.
Buttons With The Same Name And Content Are Selected In Unison Allows single-click selection of multiple related

radio buttons. For example, if the user selects a radio button that has the same field name and selected content as
another, both radio buttons are selected.

Text Fields
Text fields accept user input, which can be alphabetic characters, numbers, or both.
Alignment Aligns the text left, right, or center within the field.
Default Value Specifies the text that appears until the user overwrites it by typing in the field. Enter the default value

by typing in this option.
Multi-line Allows more than a single-line entry in the text field.
Scroll Long Text Compensates for text that extends beyond the boundaries of the text field.
Allow Rich Text Formatting Allows users to apply styling information to the text, such as bold or italic. This might be

useful in certain text fields where such styling information is important to the meaning of the text, such as an essay.
Limit Of Characters Allows entries of up to the number of characters you specify.

Note: If you entered a default value, that value is clipped to this limit.
Password Displays the user-entered text as a series of asterisks (*). This option is available only if Check Spelling is

deselected.
Field Is Used For File Selection Allows the user to enter a file path as the field’s value when a file is submitted along with

the form. This option is available only when Scroll Long Text is the only selected option in the Options tab.
Check Spelling Checks the spelling of user-entered text.
Comb Of Characters Spreads the user-entered text evenly across the width of the text field. If a border color is specified

in the Appearance tab, each character entered in the field is separated by lines of that color. This option is available only
when no other check box is selected.

Custom Calculation Script Displays any custom scripts you have added for calculations. The Edit button opens a dialog

box in which you can write and add new JavaScripts.

Set the calculation order of form fields
When you define two or more calculations in a form, the order in which they are carried out is the order in which you
defined the calculations. In some cases, you may need to modify the calculation order to obtain correct results.
For example, if you wanted to use the result obtained from calculating two form fields to calculate the value of a third
form field, the first two form fields must be calculated together first to obtain the correct final results.

in which you can write custom calculation scripts for your barcode.
Reference To published Form Shows the path to the PDF form. You can edit this by typing in the URL to the published
form. Later, you can re-create a digital version of the completed form by merging the form template with an instance
of user-supplied data. You can also maintain the relationship between a specific form template and its related barcode
data files. When you encode a barcode using XML values, the URL reference is encoded into the barcode and is
displayed on the form, below the barcode.

About buttons
Buttons are most commonly associated with forms, but you can add them to any document. Buttons can open a file,
play a sound or movie clip, submit data to a web server, and much more. When deciding on how to initiate an action,
remember that buttons offer the following capabilities that links and bookmarks do not:

• A button can activate a single action or a series of actions.
• A button can change appearance in response to mouse actions.
• A button can be easily copied across many pages.
• Mouse actions can activate different button actions. For example, Mouse Down (a click), Mouse Up (releasing after
a click), Mouse Enter (moving the pointer over the button), and Mouse Exit (moving the pointer away from the
button) can all start a different action for the same button.
Buttons are an easy, intuitive way to let users initiate an action in PDF documents. Buttons can have a combination
of labels and icons to lead users through a series of actions or events by changing as the mouse is moved. For
example, you can create buttons with “Play,” “Pause,” and “Stop” labels and appropriate icons. Then you can set
actions for these buttons to play, pause, and stop a movie clip. You can select any combination of mouse behaviors
for a button and specify any combination of actions for a mouse behavior.

Add a button to an Acrobat DC PDF form
1 Make sure you are in edit mode by selecting Tools &amp;gt; Prepare Form, and then select Button

in the

toolbar. Your curser becomes a cross hair.
2 On the page, click where you want to add the button to create a button with the default size. For a custom size button,

drag a rectangle to define the size of the button.
3 Double-click the button field, and then specify a name, tool tip text, and other common properties.
4 Click the Appearance tab, and then specify options to determine the button appearance on the page. Remember, if

you select a background color, you are not able to see through to any images behind the button. The text options
affect the label you specify in the Options tab, not the button name in the General tab.
Note: If Enable Right-To-Left Language Options is selected in the International panel of the Preferences dialog box, the
Appearance tab includes options for changing the digit style and text direction for buttons.
5 Click the Options tab, and select options to determine how labels and icons appear on the button.
6 Click the Actions tab. Specify options to determine what happens when the button is clicked, such as jumping to a

different page or playing a media clip.
7 Click Close.

If you’re creating a set of buttons, you can snap the object to grid lines or guides.

Add a submit button
When you distribute a form, Acrobat DC automatically checks the form. If it doesn’t find a submit button, it adds a
Submit Form button to the document message bar. Users can click the Submit Form button to send completed forms
back to you. If you don’t plan to use the Submit Form button created by Acrobat DC, you can add a custom submit
button to your form.
1 If you are not in form editing mode, choose Tools &amp;gt; Prepare Form.

, drag across the area where you want the button to appear. Double-click the
button and set options in the General and Options tabs.

3 In the Options tab, choose an option in the Layout menu for the button label, icon image, or both. Do one or both

of the following:

• Type text in the Label box to identify the button as a submit button.
• Click Choose Icon and either type the path to an image file or click Browse and locate the image file you want to
use.
4 In the Actions tab, choose Submit A Form in the Select Action menu, and then click Add.
5 In the Submit Form Selections dialog box, do one of the following:

• To collect form data on a server, type the location in the Enter a URL for this link box. For example,
http://www.[domain]/[folder]/[subfolder]/ for an Internet address or \\[server]\[folder]\[subfolder]\ for a
location on a local network.
• To collect form data as attachments to email, type mailto: followed by the email address. For example,
mailto:nobody@adobe.com.
6 Select options for Export Format, Field Selection, and Date Options, and click OK.

Note: If the data returns in FDF or XFDF format, the server URL must end with the #FDF suffix—for example,
http://myserver/cgi-bin/myscript#FDF.

Submit Form Selections options
The following options are available in the Submit Forms Selections dialog box:
Enter a URL for this link Specifies the URL to collect the form data.
FDF Returns the user input without sending back the underlying PDF file. You can select options to include Field Data,
Comments, and Incremental Changes To The PDF.

Note: Selecting the option for incremental changes is useful for receiving digital signatures in a way that is easily read and
reconstructed by a server.
HTML Returns the form in Hypertext Markup Language.
XFDF Returns the user input as an XML file. You can include Comments with the field data or just the field data.
PDF Returns the entire PDF file with the user input.
Field Selection Specifies what fields are returned. To receive only some of the completed field data, select Only These,
click Select Fields, and select which fields to include or exclude in the Field Selection dialog box.

For example, you might use this to exclude some calculated or duplicate fields that appear in the form for the user’s
benefit but which do not add new information.
Date Options Standardizes the format for dates that the user enters.

Making buttons change appearance
A button can have a label, an icon, or both. You can change how the button appears in each mouse state (Up, Down,
and Rollover). For example, you could create a button that has a “Home” label until the pointer is moved over the
button, when it might have a “Click to return to home page” label.

You can make button icons from any file format that Acrobat DC can display, including PDF, JPEG, GIF, and other
image formats. For whichever format you select, the entire page is used, so if you want to use only a portion of a page
as an icon, you need to crop the image or page before carrying out this procedure. The smallest allowable PDF page size
is 1-by-1 inch (2.54-by-2.54 cm). If you want the icon to appear smaller than 1-by-1 inch, scale it to fit the size of the
box drawn with the button tool. Clicking Advanced in the Options tab of the Button Properties dialog box lets you
determine how a button icon is scaled to fit inside a button.

A Label only B Icon only C Icon top, label bottom D Label top, icon bottom E Icon left, label right F Label left, icon right G Label over icon

Edit a button
1 If you are not in form editing mode, choose Tools &amp;gt; Prepare Form.

6 To make sure that either the top and bottom or left and right sides of the icon are flush against the button edges,

select Fit To Bounds.
7 To define where the icon is placed inside the button, drag the slider arrows. Icon placement is defined according to

the percentage of space preserved between the icon and the left field boundary, and between the icon and the bottom
field boundary. The default setting (50, 50) places the icon in the middle of a field. You can click Reset at any time
to revert to the default placement setting.
8 Click OK, and then click Close.

Hide an Acrobat DC button except during rollover
In some cases, you may want the button area to be invisible until the pointer moves over it. By alternately showing and
hiding a button, you can create interesting visual effects in a document. For example, when you move a pointer over a
city on a map, a detail map of the city could be displayed, and the detail map could disappear when the pointer moves
away from the city.

7 If you are in the edit mode, click Preview. The image field you defined appears as the pointer rolls over the button

area and disappears when it exits.
If you want the image to be larger than the rollover area, or if you want the image to be in a different location than
the image button that pops up, use the Show/Hide A Field action. First, you specify an icon for the button that will
be shown and hidden. Next, you create a second button that acts as a hot spot when the mouse rolls over it. You do not
assign an icon for the appearance of the second button. Instead, you use the Actions tab to show the first button when
the pointer enters the second button, and hide the first button when the pointer exits.

About web forms
PDF forms can be useful for submitting and collecting information over the web. This is done by providing several
button actions that perform functions similar to some HTML scripting macros. You must have a Common Gateway
Interface (CGI) application on the web server to collect and route the data to a database. Any existing CGI application
that collects data from forms (in HTML, FDF, or XML format) can be used.
Before you make your forms web-ready, make sure that your form-field names match those sets in the CGI application.
Note: CGI scripts must be built outside Acrobat DC, and their creation is not covered by the Adobe Acrobat DC product.

Add submit functionality
Use the Submit A Form action to send form data to an email address or to a web server by specifying a URL. You can
also use the submit button to send other files back to a server or database. For example, you can attach scanned images
or files to a form. The files are submitted along with the rest of the form data when you click the Submit button.
If your PDF form contains an email-based submit button, you can use the Distribute workflow to facilitate distributing
the form to others.
1 Choose Tools &amp;gt; Prepare Form, then select Button

in the toolbar, and create a button.

2 Double-click the button to open the Button Properties dialog box.
3 Click the Actions tab, and select Mouse Up from the Select Trigger menu.
4 Select Submit A Form from the Select Action menu, and then click Add.
5 In the Submit Form Selections dialog box, type an entry in Enter A URL For This Link:

• To send the form data to a web server, enter the destination URL.
• To send the form data to an email address, enter mailto: followed by the email address. For example, type
mailto:nobody@adobe.com.
6 Make additional changes to the available options, and then click OK to close the dialog box.

For information on the available options, see the next section.

Submit Form Selections options
FDF Exports as an FDF file. You can select one or more of the available options: user-entered data, comments, and
incremental changes to the PDF file. The Incremental Changes To The PDF option is useful for exporting a digital
signature in a way a server can easily read and reconstruct.

Note: If the server returns data to the user in FDF or XFDF format, the server’s URL must end with the #FDF suffix—for
example, http://myserver/cgi-bin/myscript#FDF.
HTML Exports as an HTML file.
XFDF Exports as an XML file. You can choose to export the form fields data, comments, or both.
PDF The Complete Document Exports the entire PDF file that is your form. Although this creates a larger file than the
FDF option, it is useful for preserving digital signatures.

Note: If the users that fill in the PDF form are using Adobe Reader, you must choose either FDF or XFDF for the Export
Format option.
All Fields Exports all form fields even if the form fields do not contain values.
Only These Exports only the form fields you specify by clicking Select Fields and indicating which form fields to
include and whether you want to include empty fields.
Convert Date To Standard Format Exports all form dates in a single format, regardless of how they are entered in the

form.

Add a Reset Form button
A Reset Form button clears any data a user has already entered in the form. It is like the Tools &amp;gt; Prepare Form &amp;gt; More

• Select All.
The list in the Actions tab now shows Reset A Form nested under the Mouse Up action.
6 Click another tab in the Button Properties dialog box to continue defining properties for the button, or click Close.

Add an Import Data button
Use the Import Form Data action to enable users to fill out common form fields, such as name and email address, with
data imported from another form. Users can also use the Import Data button to populate common form fields with
their personal profile information. Only form fields that match are updated. The fields that do not match are ignored.
Before you create an Import Form Data action, set up a form with common information form fields from which to
export the data.

5 Locate and select an FDF file, and click Open.
6 Click another tab in the Button Properties dialog box to continue defining properties for the button, or click Close.

CGI export values
An export value is the information sent to a CGI application to identify a user-selected form field. You need to define
an export value only if both of the following are true:

• The data is collected electronically in a database over a company intranet or the web.
• The data is different from the item designated by the form field, or the form field is a radio button.
When defining export values, keep the following guidelines in mind:

• Use the default export value (Yes) to indicate that a check box or radio button has been selected.
• Enter an export value for drop-down lists only if you want the value to be different from the item listed—for
example, to match the name of the form field in a database. The item selected in the drop-down list is used as the
export value unless a different export value is explicitly entered in the Properties dialog box.
• Related radio buttons must have exactly the same form field name but different export values. This ensures that the
radio buttons toggle and that the correct values will be collected in the database.

Create form fields
In Acrobat DC, you create a form field by choosing one of the form tools. For each field type, you can set various options
through the form field Properties dialog box.
1 After you convert your document to a PDF form, do one of the following:

• Choose a form field from the toolbar.
• Right-click the page and select a field.
Your cursor becomes a crosshair, and displays a preview of the field.
2 On the page, click where you want to add the field to create a field with the default size. To create a field using a

custom size, drag a rectangle to define the size of the field.
3 In the Field Name box, type the name of the field and specify if you want the field to be a required field. Choose a

name that is relevant and descriptive to make organizing and collecting the data easier.
4 To display the Properties dialog box and modify any other field properties, click All Properties.

Note: If you have selected the Keep Tool Selected option in the toolbar, the Field Name box doesn’t appear after
adding a field. Each time you click the page, a new field is added to the form. To exit this mode, press the Esc key or
click the Select Object Tool button. To modify the properties of the field, double-click the field.
5 To test your form, click the Preview button in the toolbar. Previewing a form allows you to view the form the same

way the form recipients will and gives you a chance to verify the form. If you are previewing a form, you can click
the Edit button to go back to the edit mode.
6 When your form is complete, click the cross button towards the right end of the toolbar to close form editing.

Lay out form fields on a grid
You can use grids to help position form fields precisely on a page. You can define the grid spacing, color, and position.
You can also choose whether to have the boundaries of a form field snap to grid lines when you’re editing the form field.
Grid lines don’t print.
1 Choose View &amp;gt; Show/Hide &amp;gt; Rulers &amp; Grids &amp;gt; Grid.
2 To make form fields snap to the nearest grid lines when you create or move them, choose View &amp;gt; Show/Hide &amp;gt;

Rulers &amp; Grids &amp;gt; Snap To Grid.

Copy a form field
You can create copies of a form field on a single page of a PDF form. You can also copy a form field and paste it onto
other pages. When you create duplicate form fields, replicas of the original field are added to one or more other pages.
The duplicate fields are always in the same position on each page as the original. Both copies and duplicates can be
dragged to different locations on a page, but not from one page to another.
Both copies and duplicates are created with the same basic name as the original form field. Copies and duplicates pasted
using the Duplicate Across Pages command also have a number appended. All form fields with the same basic name
share the same user data and action properties. Consequently, when a user adds or edits a response to a copy or
duplicate field, the response appears in all fields with the same basic name.
If you change the properties of any one of multiple versions of a form field with the same basic name, those changes
affect only that copy of the form field. The exception is when you change an Actions listing if the trigger isn’t a mouse
action.

PDF barcode form fields
More Help topics
PDF forms basics

About barcodes
Barcode fields translate a user’s form entries into a visual pattern that can be scanned, interpreted, and
incorporated into a database. Barcodes are helpful when users submit the form on paper or by fax.

The advantages of using barcodes are that they save time, eliminate the need for responses to be manually read and
recorded, and bypass data-entry errors that can occur.
A typical barcode workflow includes the following phases:

• The form author makes sure that Automatically Calculate Field Values is selected in the forms preferences, and then
creates the form in Acrobat, setting up all the other fields as usual.
• The form author adds the barcode field to the form, setting up the barcode so that it captures the needed data.
• The form author enables the form for Acrobat Reader DC users (if the author wants to allow the users to save their
own filled-in copy of the form or if it contains certain barcode fields).
• The form author distributes the form to other users.
• Users fill in the form on their computers and submit it electronically or print a copy and deliver the copy to the form
distributor.
• The received barcode data is interpreted in one of the following ways, and can then be reviewed, sorted, and used
by the form receiver:
Forms faxed to a fax server
The form receiver can use Adobe Acrobat Capture® to collect TIFF images from the fax server and place them in an
Adobe LiveCycle Barcoded Forms Decoder watched folder, if the receiver owns those products.

Last updated 5/10/2016

234
Forms

Forms delivered on paper
The form receiver can scan paper forms and then use an application such as LiveCycle Barcoded Forms Decoder to
decode the barcodes within those forms.
Note: Acrobat Capture and LiveCycle Barcoded Forms Decoder are stand-alone products appropriate for enterprise
workflows and are sold separately from Acrobat.

Design tips for barcodes
Issues that affect how you design and place barcodes include usability and space. As an example, the barcode size can
also limit the amount of data that can be encoded. For the best results, follow these guidelines.

• Position the barcode so that it’s unlikely to get folded when placed in an envelope, and position it far enough from
the edges of the page so that it won’t get clipped off during printing or faxing.
• Position it so that it can be easily seen and scanned. If a handheld scanner will be used, avoid barcodes wider than
4 inches (10.3 cm). Tall, narrow barcodes generally work best in this case. Also, avoid compressing the contents of
the barcode when using a handheld scanner.
• Make sure that the size of the barcode can accommodate the amount of data to encode. If the barcode area is too
small, it turns a solid gray. Be sure to test a completed form before distributing it to make sure that the barcode area
is large enough.

Create, test, and edit barcode fields
One of the ways in which you can improve a PDF form barcode is by creating custom scripts. Writing such scripts
requires a basic competency with JavaScript and a familiarity with Acrobat-specific JavaScript. For more information,
see Developing Acrobat®Applications Using JavaScript™ on www.adobe.com/go/learn_acr_javascript_en (PDF, English
only). For information about basic JavaScript, see any of the many resources available on that subject.
After inserting a barcode of maximum size, changing the cell size or decode condition may cause the barcode to cross
the page borders. Avoid this behavior by selecting the appropriate cell size and decode conditions for the barcode.

Add a barcode field
1 Open the form in Acrobat DC. Open the Preferences dialog box (Edit &amp;gt; Preferences), and select Forms on the left.

Then select Automatically Calculate Field Values.
2 Choose Tools &amp;gt; Prepare Form.
3 Click the Barcode icon

in the toolbar.

4 Drag a rectangle to define the barcode area, and then double-click the barcode field to open the Properties dialog

box.
5 In the Value tab, do one of the following:

• Select Encode Using, and then select a format (XML or Tab Delimited). Click the Pick button and select the fields
that you want to be encoded in the barcode field. If you don’t want to include the field names in the barcode data,
deselect Include Field Names.
• Select Custom Calculation Script, click Edit, and then enter your custom JavaScript code in the JavaScript Editor
dialog box.
6 In the Options tab, do all of the following:

• Select a Symbology option: PDF417, QR Code, orData Matrix.

Last updated 5/10/2016

235
Forms

• Select Compress Data Before Encoding To Barcode if you want to apply this compression. Do not select this
option if a handheld scanner is used to capture data from returned forms.
• In Decode Condition, choose the type of hardware to process returned forms: Handheld Barcode Scanner, Fax
Server,Document Scanner, or Custom.
• If necessary, click Custom and enter values for X Dimension, Y/X Ratio, and Error Correction Level.
7 Make any other changes in the General and Actions tabs. Then close the Barcode Field Properties dialog box.

JavaScript code is generated automatically to encode the selected fields in the XML or Tab Delimited format. The
Barcode Field Properties dialog box closes, and the barcode for which you specified values appears on the form.
Note: If you add a new field to a form after you have created the barcode, it is not automatically included in the data
for existing barcodes. However, you can manually include additional data fields in the barcode.

Test a barcode field
1 Click the Preview button in the toolbar.
2 Fill in the form. Use sample data that represents the maximum amount of information for each field or that you

expect users to enter.
3 If the barcode field is dimmed, follow either the procedure for resizing the barcode field or for adjusting the content

data. (See the following tasks.)
4 Make sure that the barcode field area is large enough to contain all of the incoming data. To remove the sample data,

in the right hand pane, choose More &amp;gt;Clear Form.
5 Select File &amp;gt; Save.

The barcode form field is now ready for distribution.

Include additional data fields in the barcode
1 If you are not in the form editing mode, choose Tools &amp;gt; Prepare Form.
2 Double-click the barcode field.
3 In the Value tab, do one of the following:

• If Encode Using is selected, click Pick, and select additional form fields to be encoded.
• If Custom Calculation Script is selected, click Edit, and write additional JavaScript to include the additional
fields.
After including new data fields in the barcode, be sure that the barcode area is large enough by testing sample data. If
the barcode area is dimmed, adjust the barcode size or text field properties so that the data content fits into the barcode
area.

Adjust data content to fit in a barcode field
1 If you are not in the form editing mode, choose Tools &amp;gt; Prepare Form.
2 Double-click the barcode field, and do any of the following:

• In the Options tab, click the Custom button and enter lower values for Error Correction Level and Y/X Ratio.
• In the Options tab, select Compress Data Before Encoding To Barcode, but only if you are using an Adobe
software decoder (available separately).
• In the Value tab, select Tab Delimited rather than XML as the data-encoding format. XML requires more barcode
area to encode information than Tab Delimited does.

Forms

• In the Options tab, select a different Symbology option.
• In the Value tab, click the Pick button, and deselect any fields that don’t need encoding. For example, don’t
include fields with redundant information.
• In the Value tab, enter a custom script that converts user-entered text to either all lowercase or all uppercase
characters during the encoding process.
Note: The National Association of Computerized Tax Processors (NACTP) guidelines, used by the United States
Internal Revenue Service and state tax agencies, recommend using all uppercase characters for 2D barcode data.
3 To minimize the amount of barcode area for containing the data, double-click the barcode field, and in the Value

tab, write a custom script that restricts data to alphanumeric characters and to a single case. (Text that is either all
uppercase or all lowercase requires less barcode area than the same text written in a mixture of uppercase and
lowercase characters.)
Consider creating additional barcode fields in the form and mapping different data to each barcode field.

Set form field navigation
If a PDF document doesn’t have a specified tab order, the default tabbing order is based on the document structure
unless the user has deselected the Tab Order option in the Accessibility preferences.
You can change the tabbing order after you create the fields. If you are in form editing mode, you can order the tabs by
document structure (default), row, or column. You can also choose the order manually by dragging and dropping fields
in the Fields panel. If you are not in the editing mode, you can change the page properties to order the tabs by row or
column. However, you can’t customize the tab order manually.

Import form data
In some workflow scenarios, individuals submit filled-in forms as data-only files rather than as complete PDF files.
These files are not PDFs, but use another file format, such as FDF or XML. You can view the data submitted by an
individual recipient in the context of the PDF by opening the original file and importing the information in the data file.
1 In Acrobat DC, open the PDF form into which you want to import data.
2 Choose Tools &amp;gt; Prepare Form. In the right hand pane, choose More &amp;gt; Clear Form.

Note: When you import data from another file into a PDF form, the imported data replaces any information that
appeared previously in the individual form fields. However, if the imported data file contains one or more blank form
fields, importing will not clear the original data.
3 Choose More &amp;gt; Import Data.
4 In the Select File Containing Form Data dialog box, select a format in File Of Type corresponding to the data file

you want to import. Then locate and select that file, and click Open.

Add headers, footers, and Bates numbering to PDFs
Headers, footers, and Bates numbering
Acrobat DC lets you add a header and footer throughout a PDF. Headers and footers can include a date, automatic page
numbering, Bates numbers for legal documents, or the title and author. You can add headers and footers to one or more
PDFs.
You can vary the headers and footers within a PDF. For example, you can add a header that displays the page number
on the right side of odd-numbered pages, and another header that displays the page number on the left side of evennumbered pages. When adding Bates numbering, you can set the number of digits, the starting number, and the prefix
or suffix to be appended to each Bates number.
You can define and save your headers and footers to reuse them later, or you can simply apply a header and footer and
forget it. After applying a header and footer, you can edit, replace, or delete it in the PDF. You can also preview headers
and footers before applying them and adjust the header and footer margins so that they don’t overlap other page
content.

Add headers and footers, with an open document
1 Open the PDF file to which you want to add the header and footer.
2 Choose Tools &amp;gt; Edit PDF.

The Edit PDF toolset is displayed in the secondary toolbar.
Note: Formatting and other related options are displayed in the right-hand pane.
3 In the secondary toolbar, choose Header &amp; Footer &amp;gt; Add.
4 As needed, specify the Font and Margin values.

The text properties apply to all header and footer entries that are part of this setting definition. You cannot apply
different settings to individual header or footer text boxes within the same session in the Add Header And Footer
dialog box.
To prevent overlapping, click the Appearance Options link and select Shrink Document To Avoid Overwriting The
Document’s Text And Graphics. To prevent resizing or repositioning when printing the PDF in large format, select
Keep Position And Size Of Header/Footer Text Constant When Printing On Different Page Sizes.

Add a Bates numbering header or footer (Acrobat Pro DC)
Bates numbering is a method of indexing legal documents for easy identification and retrieval. Each page of each
document is assigned a unique Bates number that also indicates its relationship to other Bates-numbered documents.
Bates numbers appear as headers or footers on the pages of each PDF in the batch.
The Bates identifier is referred to as a number, but it can include an alphanumeric prefix and suffix. The prefix and
suffix can make it easier to recognize the central subject matter of the files.
Note: Bates numbering is unavailable for protected or encrypted files and some forms.

Add Bates numbering
When designating documents for Bates numbering, you can add PDFs, and any non-PDF files that can be converted
to PDF. The process converts non-PDF file types to PDF, and then adds Bates numbers to the resulting PDF.
1 Choose Tools &amp;gt; Edit PDF.

The Edit PDF toolset is displayed in the secondary toolbar.
2 In the secondary toolbar, choose More &amp;gt; Bates Numbering &amp;gt; Add.
3 In the Bates Numbering dialog box, click Add Files, and choose Add Files, Add Folders, or Add Open Files. Then

select the files or folder.
Note: If you add a folder that contains files other than PDFs, the non-PDF files are not added.
If any files are password-protected, one or more messages appear, in which you must enter the correct password.
4 As needed, do any of the following in the list of files:

• To change the order in which Bates numbers are assigned, select a file, then drag it or click Move Up or Move
Down.
• To sort the list, click a column name. Click again to sort in reverse order.
5 To specify a target folder for output files and filename preferences, click Output Options. Specify the options as

Add watermarks to PDFs
A watermark is text or an image that appears either in front of or behind existing document content, like a stamp. For
example, you could apply a “Confidential” watermark to pages with sensitive information. You can add multiple
watermarks to one or more PDFs, but you must add each watermark separately. You can specify the page or range of
pages on which each watermark appears.
Note: Unlike a stamp, a watermark is integrated into PDF pages as a fixed element. A stamp is a type of PDF comment,
which others reading the PDF can open to display a text annotation, move, change, or delete.

Overview of PDF Portfolios
About PDF Portfolios
A PDF Portfolio contains multiple files assembled into an integrated PDF unit. The files in a PDF Portfolio can be in a
wide range of file types created in different applications. For example, a PDF Portfolio can include text documents, email messages, spreadsheets, CAD drawings, and PowerPoint presentations. The original files retain their individual
identities but are assembled into one PDF Portfolio file. You can open, read, edit, and format each component file
independently of the other component files in the PDF Portfolio.
Depending on the circumstances, PDF Portfolios offer several advantages over merging multiple files into a single PDF:
Adding and deleting Add or remove files easily, without having to find and select all the pages that originated in that

file.
Previewing Quickly preview component files without having to open them in their native applications.
Editing Change individual files within the PDF Portfolio without affecting the other files. For example, you can

renumber pages in one document without renumbering other documents in the PDF Portfolio. You can also edit nonPDF files in their native applications from within a PDF Portfolio. Any changes you make are saved to the file within
the PDF Portfolio.
Distribution Share a PDF Portfolio with others and be sure that they are getting all the component parts. Publish a PDF
Portfolio on a website for others to view.
Sorting Sort component files by categories that you can add to, delete, hide, and customize. Simply click a column

name to sort the list.
Printing Print all the PDFs in a PDF Portfolio, or selected component PDFs.
Searching Search one or all files in a PDF Portfolio. You can even search non-PDF component files.
Incorporating other formats Add non-PDF files to an existing PDF Portfolio without converting them to PDF.
Independence from source files The source files of a PDF Portfolio—even existing files you add to the PDF Portfolio—

are not changed when you create a PDF Portfolio. Changes you make to the component files within a PDF Portfolio do
not change the original files from which you created the PDF Portfolio. You can move a PDF Portfolio anywhere on
your computer or network without any risk of losing or disconnecting its components.
Reuse Include the same file in multiple PDF Portfolios.

PDF Portfolio window overview
In Acrobat DC, you create and edit PDF Portfolios, and work with component files using various elements, such as
panes, toolbars, and windows.

• The PDF Portfolio toolbar is located immediately below the main toolbar. You can perform common tasks such as,
adding files or folders, creating a new folder, extracting component file, or deleting a component file.
• The left navigation pane lists the files and folders included in the PDF Portfolio. By default, the files and folders are
displayed alphabetically. You can change the order by configuring the sort order in the Portfolio Properties dialog
box.
• The Previous and Next buttons allow you to scroll through the files and folders included in the PDF Portfolio. A
preview of the selected file is displayed by default. However, if the component file is a non-PDF file, then a Preview
button is displayed in the document area. Clicking the Preview button allows you to view the file’s contents in the
PDF Portfolio itself.
• The Open Document link opens the selected component file for editing. If it is a PDF file, then the file is opened in
the document area where you can work on it like any other PDF document. Else, if the file is non-PDF, then it is
opened in its native application. Once you make changes in the component file and save it, the newer content is
made available in the PDF Portfolio.
• Layout (Preview mode) shows the preview of the component file in the PDF Portfolio depending on the type of file.
For information about each type of preview, see Portfolio view modes
• Details or Files mode shows the file details in a list. You can click a column name to sort by ascending and
descending order.
A PDF Portfolio is accessible when it opens in Details or Files mode. This mode provides a better reading experience
for people with disabilities—such as mobility impairments, blindness, and low vision. To open all PDF Portfolios in
Files mode, open the Preferences dialog box by choosing Edit &amp;gt; Preferences (Windows). In Acrobat DC only, choose
Acrobat &amp;gt; Preferences (Mac OS). Under Categories, select Accessibility, and then select Show Portfolios In Files
Mode.

Portfolio view modes
You can view the component files in two different ways – Layout (or Preview) mode and Details (or Files mode). In
Layout mode, the component files list is presented in the left navigation pane, as shown in the preceding figure. In
Details mode, the component files list is presented immediately below the secondary toolbar, as shown in the following
screenshot:

In both the views, you can preview images and pages, play video and SWF files. However, in the Details view you can
also view information about a file. You can extract (move) a file to your computer. You can also open a file in its native
application (if installed on your computer). You can switch between the Layout and Details view by choosing the
desired option from the View &amp;gt; Portfolio menu.
The Platform preview mode is also available where a full-size preview within the document window is shown. By
default, the PDF, SWF, and HTML files are displayed in the document window. To open other file types in Platform
preview, such as e-mail portfolios, form response files, and secured PDFs, choose View &amp;gt; Portfolio &amp;gt; Preview File. To
close Platform preview, click the Close Preview (X) icon after the filename in the secondary toolbar.

Chapter 7: Reviews and commenting

Mark up text with edits
Note: In Reader, complete commenting tools are available only in PDFs that have commenting enabled. PDFs in a review
workflow typically include commenting rights.
You can use text edit comments in a PDF to indicate where text should be edited in the source file. Text edit comments
do not change the actual text in the PDF. Instead, they indicate which text should be deleted, inserted, or replaced in
the source file from which the PDF was created.
Acrobat offers two basic methods to add text edit annotations: pre-select and post-select.
Pre-select or Text Correction Markup tool
Use the Select tool
, or the Text Correction Markup tool and then right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac OS)
on the selected text to open a menu of text editing options. After marking the text, you can also click on a text edit tool.
Post-select
Click the text edit tool and then select the text.
In Acrobat for Windows, you can export text edits directly to the Microsoft Word document that the PDF is based on
to revise the source document. To use this feature, you must use PDFMaker in Word to create the PDF. Before you
export your text edits, make sure that insertion comments use the exact text, including spaces and paragraph returns,
that you want to add. If you add extra instructional words (such as “Add the following:”), these words will have to be
deleted manually from the Word document.
In Acrobat Pro on Windows, you can export text edit comments directly to an Autodesk AutoCAD document that the
PDF is based on to incorporate your edits. To use this feature, you must use PDFMaker in AutoCAD to create the PDF.

A Selected text is struck out. B New text is added to a linked pop-up note.

Replace text
1 From the Tools &amp;gt; Comment toolbar, scelect Add Note to Replace Text
2 Select the text. Any selected text is crossed out and a pop-up note opens.

About managed PDF reviews
In a managed review, you use a wizard to set up your review, specify the document location, and invite participants.
You don’t have to import comments, enable commenting for Reader users, or manually track reviewer responses.
Note: You must have Acrobat Pro DC installed to enable commenting for Acrobat Reader DC users in managed reviews.
You cannot enable commenting for Acrobat Reader DC users using Acrobat Standard DC.
Acrobat includes two types of managed reviews: shared and email-based reviews. Each type of review has a wizard that
helps you distribute a PDF with special tools and instructions to reviewers.
The Tracker tracks all managed reviews. The Tracker provides access to the PDF file and information about the review
and its participants. Review initiators can change review deadlines, add reviewers, and end reviews from the Tracker.
The Tracker lets participants know when new comments are available, when deadlines are changed, and when
reviewers are added, even when Acrobat is closed. It also provides information about server error states.

Shared reviews are the most collaborative form of review because participants can read and reply to the comments of
other participants. Comments from participants are stored in a repository on an internal server. Acrobat synchronizes
comments at regular intervals to download all the latest changes. Reviewers are notified of new comments as they are
added, and they can see and reply to comments made by other reviewers.

Note: For shared reviews, reviewers must have Acrobat 8 or later or Reader 8 or later installed to view other reviewer
comments. Reviewers using earlier versions of Acrobat must send comments in email.
Email-based reviews
Email-based reviews are ideal when reviewers either don’t have access to a common server or don’t require a
collaborative approach to reviewing documents.
In an email-based review, the initiator sends a PDF to reviewers as an email attachment. Reviewers add their comments
and return the document by using the Send Comments button in the document message bar. When receiving these
comments, the initiator can merge them into their copy of the PDF.
The primary limitation to email-based reviews is that participants can’t view other comments during the review.
Initiators can view comments only after receiving them.
Note: Participants in an email-based review must have Acrobat 6.0 or later or Reader 7.0 or later.

Choosing a distribution option for reviews and forms
Acrobat provides several distribution options in the Send For Shared Review and Distribute Form wizard. When you
choose an option, consider the security needs for the distributed file, what servers or websites your recipients can use
to download the file, and how you want to receive comments or form data.
Internal server
You can use your own internal server location if your recipients work behind a firewall and all have access to a common
server. The server can be a network folder, a Microsoft SharePoint workspace (Windows only), or a web server folder.
You can include a link to your distributed PDF or send it as an attachment in an email message. For reviews, Acrobat
uploads published comments to the server. For forms, Acrobat stores responses on your hard drive as they are returned.
Note: Web server folders are not available for form distribution.
When you specify your own server, the wizard prompts you to save a profile with the server location and the
distribution options you chose. The next time you distribute a PDF, the saved profile is available as an option in the
wizard.
Email
The Distribute Forms wizard has an option for sending a form as an email attachment. You can send the form using
your own email client or webmail. You can also use the wizard to create an email message in which the form file is
attached. Once your recipients fill out and submit the form, the responses are returned to your mailbox. Each response
is copied into a PDF Portfolio responses file, which you can organize and export to a spreadsheet.
The Send for Shared Review wizard lets you either email a link to the pdf, or attach the pdf to the email.

Enable commenting for Reader users (Acrobat Pro DC)
By enabling commenting rights in a PDF, users of Reader 8 or later can participate in reviews of that PDF. When a PDF
with commenting rights opens in Reader, it includes a document message bar and commenting tools that are otherwise
unavailable.
When you initiate a managed review, commenting rights are automatically enabled. If you do not use a managed review
(for example, if you send a PDF directly in email), you can still enable commenting rights.

• Open the PDF and choose File &amp;gt; Save As Other &amp;gt; Reader Extended PDF &amp;gt; Enable Commenting and Measuring.
Note: If you enable commenting for Reader in a digitally signed document, the signature is invalidated.

Select an email application for reviews
You need either an email application and a mail server connection, or a webmail account for email-based reviews and
to send comments. Acrobat supports most email applications. If you have more than one email application installed,
you can specify which application starts when Acrobat sends a PDF. Do one of the following:

• (Windows) Double-click Internet Options in the Control Panel. In the Internet Properties dialog box, select the
Programs tab, and then select the preferred email application. Restart Acrobat to activate the change.
• (Windows) Change the MAPI settings in your email application. Acrobat and Reader use the Messaging Application
Program Interface (MAPI) to communicate with your email application. Most email applications come with MAPI
settings to handle this communication. For more information on configuring your email applications, see the email
application’s Help.
• (Mac OS) In Mail, choose Mail &amp;gt; Preferences, select General, and then choose the preferred email application from
the Default Email Reader menu. Restart Acrobat to activate the change. If your application isn’t listed, choose Select
from the menu and browse to the location. If you select an application that isn’t listed in the Default Email Reader
menu, Acrobat does not necessarily support it.

Specify a server
If you distribute a PDF using your own server location, you can specify a network folder, a Windows server running
Microsoft SharePoint Services, or a web server folder. Participants must have read and write access to the server you
specify. Ask your network administrator to provide a suitable server location for storing comments. No additional
software is required to set up a server.
Note: Web server folders are not available for form distribution.
<!-- 31ebf6fe-f66c-4b94-8507-d4cbbf58ebc3 <=< ACCEPT -->
Network folders
If all recipients are within a local area network, network folders and SharePoint servers are the best choices for a
comment server. Network folders are generally the cheapest and most reliable.
SharePoint/Office 365 subsites
If your recipients work behind a firewall and all have access to a common server, you can use your own internal server
location, such as a Microsoft SharePoint site. For more information, see Hosting shared reviews on SharePoint or Office
365 sites.
WebDAV servers
WebDAV servers (web servers that use the WebDAV protocol) are best used only if your reviewers are outside a firewall
or a local area network. For more information on how to configure Acrobat to use a WebDAV service, see Hosting a
Shared Review: An Alternative to Acrobat.com.

Review a PDF
When you receive an email invitation to a PDF review, the invitation typically includes the PDF as an attachment or
provides a URL to the PDF. Alternatively, some invitations include a Forms Data Format (FDF) attachment. When
opened, an FDF file configures your review settings and opens the PDF in Acrobat.
PDFs in a review have special features, including commenting tools and a document message bar with instructions. Use
the commenting tools to add comments to the PDF and then submit them. Either publish the comments to a comment
server where others can see them, or send comments as an email attachment to the review initiator.
Note: It’s possible to receive a PDF that doesn’t include special features. If so, add your comments using tools in theTools &amp;gt;
Comment toolbar. Then save the PDF and send it back.

To review the PDF later, reopen it from the Tracker. Doing so ensures that your comments are added to the tracked
copy of the PDF, and that the initiator receives your comments. If you don’t send or publish your comments right away,
save the PDF before you close it to avoid losing your comments. Until the initiator receives your comments, they appear
only in your local copy of the PDF and aren’t visible to other reviewers.
If you review a PDF using Acrobat 9 or earlier, or Reader 9 or earlier, some features are not available.

Join a review
1 In your email application, open the PDF by clicking the URL or double-clicking the attachment (PDF or FDF).
2 Do one or more of the following, if prompted:

• Log in to Adobe Document Cloud with your Adobe ID and password.
• Click Connect in the Shared Review dialog box.
• Click OK in the Welcome To Shared Review window. This window shows the review deadline, participants,
whether each reviewer has made any comments, and the comment server location.
• Type your name, email address, company name, and job title.
3 Save the file to a location that you can find easily, such as the desktop.
4 Add comments to the PDF using tools in the Tools &amp;gt; Comment toolbar. To delete a comment, select it and press

Delete. (You can only delete the comments that you made.)
5 Do all of the following that apply:

• If you’re notified that new comments from other reviewers are available, click the message. New comments
appear in the PDF.
• To find out if new comments are available from other reviewers, click the Check For New Comments button

.

6 Submit your comments by clicking Publish Comments or Send Comments To Review Initiator in the document

message bar.
When you send comments, a PDF containing your comments is sent as an email attachment to the review initiator.
When you publish comments, your comments are saved to the comment server.

Options in the document message bar
The options in the document message bar depend on how the initiator set up the review and whether you can access
the comment server.
Check For New Comments Prompts Acrobat to synchronize comments between the comment server and the local hard

drive. If you don’t click this button, Acrobat checks for new comments every 10 minutes if the document is open and
every hour if the document is closed.
Merge Comments Copies the comments in the open PDF to your copy. This option is available only for PDFs you

receive from reviewers in email-based reviews.
Publish Comments Available only in shared reviews. Uploads your new comments to the comment server. This button

is disabled if the review has ended.
Save An Archive Copy Available only in shared reviews, when a review has ended. Saves a copy of the document with

review comments to your hard drive.
Send Comments Creates an email message addressed to the review initiator that contains the commented PDF as an

attachment. This option is always available for reviewers in email-based reviews. It appears in shared reviews if the
reviewer has chosen to work offline or if an attempt to connect to the comment server has failed.

with additional options appears: Track Reviews opens the Tracker; Save As Archive Copy saves a copy of the PDF that
is no longer connected to the review; Work Offline lets you work in offline mode, in which you can make comments
but cannot publish them until you switch back to online mode. To switch to online mode, click Reconnect To Server.

Check for newly published comments
When you participate in a shared review, Acrobat DC synchronizes published comments on your local hard drive with
the comments on the server. Acrobat DC notifies you when new comments are available. Because synchronization
continues after the PDF is closed, you’ll continue to receive notifications.
Messages in the notification area inform you when new reviewers join the review, when updates occur (multiple
reviews), when deadlines change, and when synchronization attempts fail. They also inform you when a new broadcast
subscription is added in the Tracker. You can change the frequency of messages and of comment synchronization, and
you can manually trigger the synchronization process.
To view new comments in a shared review, you must be able to connect to the network where the comment server is
located. If you can’t connect, check the server status in the Tracker to determine the cause of the problem.
Click the Check For New Comments button

in the document message bar.

Send comments in email
If you review a PDF offline or outside a firewall, or if you lose your connection to the comment server, you can send
your comments in an email message.
1 Choose File &amp;gt; Send File &amp;gt; Attach To Email.
2 In the Send Email dialog box, select Default Email Application, or Use Webmail and choose you webmail client from

the Selectmenu.
3 Click Continue, and follow the onscreen instructions.

Note: If the PDF exceeds the 5-MB file-size limit, Acrobat prompts you to send your comments in a Forms Data Format
(FDF) file. The initiator can import this smaller file. To adjust the limit, open the Preferences dialog box and select
Reviewing. Then enter the new value for Send Comments As FDF For Files Greater Than [#] MB.

Publish comments from other reviewers
When you participate in a review, you can receive comments from other reviewers. For example, if a reviewer can’t
access the comment server, the reviewer can send you comments. As another example, suppose that you solicited
feedback from people who weren’t initially invited to the review. Those reviewers can return a copy of the review PDF
to you with their comments. By taking ownership of the comments, you can share them with everyone in the review.
1 Open the PDF that contains comments.
2 Do one of the following:

• Click OK when asked if you want to publish comments for this reviewer. The published comments appear in the
PDF. Your name appears in the title bar and the author’s name appears in the body of the comments, preceded

You use annotation and drawing markup tools to add comments. The commenting tools are made available in the
secondary toolbar of the Comment feature. Comments are notes and drawings that communicate ideas or provide
feedback for PDFs. You can type a text message using the Sticky Note tool. Alternatively, you can use a drawing tool to
add a line, circle, or other shape and then type a message in the associated pop-up note. Text-editing tools let you add
editing marks to indicate changes that you want in the source document. Most commenting and markup tools don’t
appear in the toolbar until you enable the Commenting feature.
Note: If you open a PDF in a browser for a shared review that has ended, the commenting tools are unavailable.
Most comments include two parts: the icon, or markup, that appears on the page, and the text message that appears in
a pop-up note when you click or double-click the icon or place the pointer over the icon.
After you add a comment, it stays selected until you click elsewhere on the page. Acrobat DC highlights a selected
comment with a blue halo to help you find the markup on the page. A wireframe with selection handles appears on
drawing markups and stamps, so that you can adjust the size and shape.
In Acrobat Pro DC, you can add tags to your comments so that readers with motion or vision limitations can read them
using assistive technologies.

Note: To see the labels along with the tool icons, right-click on the secondary toolbar and select Show All Labels.

Text font and size are based on the system default settings.

Note: You can add comments to Japanese, Chinese, and Korean text with the Text Box tool, but you must have the Asianlanguage resource files installed. Text boxes allow for horizontal text only.
You can use the Callout tool
to create a callout text box. Callout text boxes are especially useful when you want to
single out—but not obscure—a particular area of a document. Callout text boxes have three parts: a text box, a knee line,
and an end-point line. You can resize each part by dragging a handle. The knee line can be resized in one direction
only; horizontal knee lines can be resized horizontally only; vertical knee lines can be resized vertically only. The text
box expands vertically as you type so that all text remains visible.
You can move the text box itself or together with the end-point line. The text box moves around a stationary anchor
point—the arrow on the end-point line—which is created when you first click in the PDF. You can modify the color
and appearance of the text box and add arrows or leaders to the end-point line.

About approval workflows
Acrobat DC users (Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, and Korean only), can send PDFs as email
attachments for others to approve. When participants open an approval request in Acrobat (all languages), they can
approve the PDF by adding a digital identity stamp. Then, they can send the PDF to other approvers, or return the PDF
to the initiator and other appropriate participants. The initiator can track progress by choosing to be notified each time
the PDF is approved. The workflow ends when the last participant adds the final approval. If a PDF isn’t approved, the
approval workflow must be reinitiated.
Note: If you use Acrobat Pro DC to initiate the workflow, you can invite users of Reader 9 or later to participate by enabling
commenting in the
PDF.
Wizard sets up approval workflows (left); Stamps palette provides stamps for approving documents (right).

Send a PDF for approval
When you send a PDF by email for approval (Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, and Korean only),
approvers receive the PDF as an email attachment. When recipients open the PDF attachment, they can apply a digital
identity stamp from the Stamps palette and then make the appropriate selection in the document message bar.
To send a PDF for approval, use the wizard in Acrobat DC. The wizard provides on-screen instructions to help you
invite approvers, customize instructions, and send the PDF.
In Acrobat Pro DC, the wizard enables commenting in the PDF so that Acrobat Reader DC users can participate in the
approval workflow.
Before you initiate an approval workflow, make sure that your email application is configured to work with Acrobat DC.
1 To start an approval workflow, choose Share &amp;gt; Send By Email For Approval.
2 If prompted, enter your email address in the Identity Setup dialog box.
3 Specify a PDF, and click Next.
4 Type the email address for the first approver in the To box.

message bar appears at the top of the PDF. If your version of Acrobat is earlier than 7.0, you’re prompted to download
the latest version of Reader.
You can select any of the digital identity stamps in the Stamps palette to approve the document. A digital identity stamp
contains identity information that you provide, such as name, title, organization, and email address. You can use an
identity stamp in place of a signature. When you apply a stamp, it becomes part of the document page content. You can
delete your own stamp during the approval process; however, once the approval process is completed, your stamp is
locked. You can’t move or delete stamps from other participants.
You can also reject documents that don’t meet your standards.
In addition to adding digital stamps to a PDF, you can add other types of comments, including note comments, text
edits, custom stamps, and file attachments.

comments, you can specify whether hidden comments are printed or summarized. When you hide a note comment
that has been replied to, all other replies in the thread are hidden as well.
Note: In an email-based review, hidden comments aren’t included when you send the comments to the initiator.
From the Filter comments menu

in the Comments list, do one of the following:

• To clear all filters, choose Show All Comments. Alternatively, use Ctrl+8 (Windows) or Command+8 (Mac OS).
• To hide all comments, choose Hide All Comments. Alternatively, use Ctrl+Shift+8 (Windows) or
Command+Shift+8 (Mac OS).
• To filter comments, choose the categories that you want to appear. For example, if you want only sticky note
comments that you haven’t accepted to appear, choose
note comments appear, and then choose

Reply to comments
Note: In Acrobat Reader DC, commenting features are available only in PDFs that have commenting enabled. PDFs in a
review workflow typically include commenting rights.
Replies to comments are especially useful in shared reviews, when participants can read each other’s comments. They
can also be used by review initiators to let reviewers know how their suggestions are being implemented. When one or
more reviewers reply to a comment, the set of replies is called a thread. The first two replies in a thread appear in the
pop-up note. In the Comments list, all replies are displayed. Replies are indented below the original comment. The
number of replies that a comment has received appears in a box when you place the pointer over the comment.

Statuses and check marks are useful for keeping track of comments that you’ve read or that require further action. In
Windows, you can use a status or a check mark to indicate which comments you want to export to a Word document.
By setting the review status, you can show or hide a group of comments and let review participants know how you are
going to handle the comment. Once the review status is set, you cannot remove the review status display from the
comment in the Comments list, even if you change the review status to None. Check marks are for your personal use
and do not appear when others view the PDF unless you change the status of comments.

Set a status
1 Select the comment in the Comments list and right-click to show the options menu. Then choose an option from

the Set Status menu.
The review status appears in the comment along with the name of who set the review status. If another reviewer sets
the review status for that comment, both reviewers’ names and review statuses appear in the Comments list.

Print a comment summary
Summarizing comments is a convenient way to get a synopsis of all the comments associated with a PDF. When you
summarize comments, you can either create a PDF with comments that you can print, or you can print the summary
directly. The summary is neither associated with nor linked to the PDF that the comments are derived from.

Importing and exporting comments
Import Comments
Note: In Acrobat Reader DC, commenting features are available only in PDFs that have commenting enabled. PDFs in a
review workflow typically include commenting rights.
Comments can be imported from a PDF document. You can also import comments from a Forms Data Format (FDF)
file or an XFDF file, which is an XML-based FDF file. You cannot open and view FDF files or XFDF files on their own.
1 In the document that you want to receive comments, from the Options menu

in the comments list,

choose Import Data File.
Note: To open the comments list, choose Tools &amp;gt; Comments.
2 Choose All Files (*.*) from the file type menu. If you know the file format of the comments you want to import,

choose it.
3 Double-click the name of the document with the comments.

The comment positioning matches that of the file from which they were imported. If comments appear out of place,
the source and recipient PDF documents are likely to be different. For example, if you import comments from a tenpage document to a two-page document, only comments from the first two pages appear.

Export comments
Note: In Acrobat Reader DC, commenting features are available only in PDFs that have commenting enabled. PDFs in a
review workflow typically include commenting rights.
If you add comments to a PDF that isn’t part of a managed review, you may need to export your comments to send them
to someone, or you may need to import comments you receive. (PDFs in a managed review workflow include special
options that let you send or publish your comments, rather than export them.)
When you export comments, you create a Forms Data Format (FDF) file that contains only comments. Consequently,
FDF files are usually smaller than PDFs. You or another reviewer can then import the comments from the FDF file into
the original PDF.

Export comments to a data file
1 From the options menu

in the comments list, choose Export All To Data File.

2 Name the file and choose Acrobat FDF Files (*.fdf) or Acrobat XFDF Files (*.xfdf) for the file type.
3 Specify a location for the file, and then click Save.

Export selected comments
Note: Exporting selected comments isn’t available in Acrobat Reader DC.
1 In the comments list, select the comments you want to export.

Note: To open the comments list, choose Tools &amp;gt; Comments.
2 From the options menu

in the comments list, choose Export Selected To Data File.

3 Name the file and choose Acrobat FDF Files (*.fdf) or Acrobat XFDF Files (*.xfdf) for the file type.
4 Specify a location for the file, and then click Save.

Export comments to Word (Windows)
In some instances, reviewers make comments in a PDF that was created from a Microsoft Word document. You can
revise the original Word document by exporting these comments from the PDF. For example, text that has been
inserted, crossed out, or replaced using the text edit tools in the PDF can be deleted or transferred directly to the source
Word document. Formatting added to comments (for example, boldface text) is lost during this process and must be
added to the Word document manually.
To revise a Word document using comments, you must create a tagged PDF from the Word document. Before you
transfer text edits from the PDF, remove any extra words or information and then merge them to one PDF (if you have
comments from multiple reviewers). If you plan to import comments more than once, you may want to make a copy of
the Word document before you import the comments or comments may not be imported correctly.
1 Do one of the following:

• From the options menu

in the comments list, choose Export To Word.

• In Word, open the source document, and then choose Acrobat Comments &amp;gt; Import Comments From Acrobat
DC. For Word 2013, click Acrobat, and then choose Acrobat Comments &amp;gt;Import Comments From
AcrobatDC.

Reviews and commenting

The Latest Updates panel provides a summary of the latest changes in shared reviews, form files, and servers. If you
have no active reviews or forms, this panel provides instructions and links for creating managed reviews, creating
forms, and distributing forms. In the Latest Updates panel, you can also turn Tracker notifications on or off inside
Acrobat and, for Windows only, in the system tray.
Reviews
The Tracker shows who’s joined a shared review and how many comments they’ve published. From the Tracker, you
can rejoin a review and email the participants. If you’ve initiated reviews, you can add or change deadlines, add
reviewers, end a review, and start a new review with existing reviewers.
The left side of the Tracker shows all PDF documents in managed reviews. The information pane on the right lists the
date and time the PDF was sent and the list of invited reviewers. Links to shared PDFs provide additional information,
including the deadline (if set) and the number of comments submitted per reviewer. Deleting a link in the Tracker
deletes the PDF and all comments from the server, and permanently ends the review.
Forms
Use Tracker to manage the forms that you have distributed or received. The Tracker allows you to view and edit the
location of the response file, and track which recipients have responded. You can also add more recipients, email all
recipients, and view the responses for a form. For more information, see About Forms Tracker .
Server Status
The Server Status shows the state of all servers being used for reviews and distributed forms. The check mark icon
next to the server name indicates that the last synchronization attempt was successful. The warning icon
indicates that the last synchronization attempt was unsuccessful. The warning icon indicates that the server is
disconnected from the network, has problems writing data to the disk, or has some other problem. Contact your
network administrator for assistance.
RSS
You can use the Tracker to subscribe to web content that uses the RSS (Really Simple Syndication) format, such as news
feeds and music channels. RSS format is compatible with XML and RDF formats.
Note: If the RSS button doesn’t appear in Tracker, open the Preferences dialog box in Acrobat DC and select Tracker. Select
Enable RSS Feeds In Tracker, and click OK. Then close and reopen Tracker.

Track reviewed PDFs
1 In the Tracker, expand the appropriate folder:
Sent Lists PDFs in reviews that you initiated. (Not available in Reader.)
Joined Contains PDFs in reviews that you’ve received. PDFs appear in this list only after you open them. If you open

a PDF from an email attachment and don’t save the PDF, the entry is removed from the Tracker when you close the
file.
Note: PDFs listed in bold contain one or more of the following updates: comments that you haven’t read yet, a deadline
update from the review initiator, and reviewers who have joined the review.
2 Select a PDF.

Information specific to the selected PDF review appears on the right. Shared reviews list deadline information,
reviewers who have joined the review, and the number of comments.

Save the PDF with comments
You can save a copy of the review PDF that contains all the comments that reviewers have published or that you’ve
imported (merged).
If the PDF is in a shared review, you can save an archive copy. The copy is no longer connected to the shared review,
and you can edit both content and comments in it.
If you want to create a copy of a shared PDF to distribute to others, use the Save As command. The resulting file includes
all comments that were published up to that point. It can be moved, copied, or renamed without affecting its connection
to the review or to the comment server.
To save a copy of a review PDF with all the comments, open the file, and then do one of the following:

• For a shared review, choose File &amp;gt; Save As Archive Copy. Alternatively, click the Status button in the document
message bar and choose Save As Archive Copy.
• For an email-based review, choose File &amp;gt;Save As to save a new copy of the PDF. This most recently saved version
is now the tracked PDF. The old version is the archive copy.

Invite additional reviewers
If you’re the review initiator, you can invite others to participate in the review. If you’re a reviewer and want other people
to participate, ask the review initiator to invite them. That way, the initiator can automatically track all participants and
receive notification when their comments are received.
1 In the Tracker, select the PDF under Sent, and then click Add Reviewers on the right.
2 Specify the email addresses of the reviewers whom you want to add. Change the message as needed and then send

the message.
Additional reviewers appear with other participants in the right pane of the Tracker.

• If the review has a deadline, click Change Deadline.
2 Click Review Deadline, change the deadline as needed, and click OK.
3 Change the email recipients, subject, and message as needed, and then click Send.

End a review
A review initiator can end an existing review. Once a review has ended, participants cannot publish comments to the
server. You can change the review deadline later if you want to restart the review.
In the Tracker, select the PDF and click End Review.

Start a shared review with the same reviewers from an existing review

Chapter 8: Saving and exporting PDFs

Saving PDFs
You can save your changes to an Adobe PDF or PDF Portfolio in the original PDF or in a copy of the PDF. You can also
save individual PDFs to other file formats, including text, XML, HTML, and Microsoft Word. Saving a PDF in text
format allows you to use the content with a screen reader, screen magnifier, or other assistive technology.
If you don’t have access to the source files that created an Adobe PDF, you can still copy images and text from the PDF
to use elsewhere. You can also export the PDF to a reusable format, or export images in a PDF to another format.
Adobe Acrobat Reader DC users can save a copy of a PDF or PDF Portfolio if the creator of the document has enabled
usage rights. If a document has additional or restricted usage rights, the document message bar under the toolbar area
describes the assigned restrictions or privileges.

Save a PDF
Use this method to save PDFs, including PDF Portfolios, and PDFs in which you have added comments, form field
entries, and digital signatures.
Note: Saving a digitally signed PDF invalidates the signature.
Do one of the following:

• To save changes to the current file, choose File &amp;gt; Save.
• To save a copy of a PDF, choose File &amp;gt; Save As.
• In Acrobat Reader DC, choose File &amp;gt; Save As or File &amp;gt; Save As Other &amp;gt; Text.
• To save a copy of a PDF Portfolio, choose File &amp;gt;Save As Other &amp;gt; PDF Portfolio.
If you are viewing a PDF in a web browser, the Acrobat File menu is not available. Use the Save A Copy button in
the Acrobat toolbar to save the PDF.

Recover the last saved version
Choose File &amp;gt; Revert, and then click Revert.

About the Autosave feature
The Autosave feature guards against losing your work in case of a power failure by incrementally, and at regular
intervals, saving file changes to a specified location. The original file is not modified. Instead, Acrobat creates an
autosave file of changes, which includes all the changes you made to the open file since the last automatic save. The
amount of new information that the autosave file contains depends on how frequently Acrobat saves the autosave file.
If you set the autosave interval to 15 minutes, you could lose the last 14 minutes of your work if a problem occurs.
Frequent automatic saving prevents loss of data, and is especially useful if you make extensive changes to a document,
such as by adding comments.

Last updated 5/10/2016

323
Saving and exporting PDFs

You can apply autosave changes to the original files when you restart Acrobat. When you close, save manually, or revert
to the last-saved version of a file, the autosave file is deleted.
Note: If you use assistive technology, such as a screen reader, you may want to disable the Autosave feature so that you don’t
lose your place when the file is reloaded.
The Autosave feature won’t work in the following cases:

• A document that has its security changed. You must save the document to re-enable automatic saving of document
changes.
• A document created using the Web Capture feature or extracted from a larger PDF (Tools &amp;gt; Organize Pages &amp;gt;
Extract). You must save the document to enable automatic saving of changes.
• A document displayed in a web browser or incorporated into a container document that supports Object Linking
and Embedding (OLE). This document appears outside the default file system and cannot support automatic saving.

Recover lost changes
To prevent lost changes after an unexpected interruption, enable the Autosave feature, which is the default setting.

Set up automatic saving
1 In the Preferences dialog box under Categories, select Documents.
2 Select Automatically Save Document Changes To Temporary File Every xx Minutes (1-99), and specify the number

of minutes.

Recover lost changes after an unexpected shutdown
1 Start Acrobat or open the file you were working on last.
2 When prompted, click Yes to open the autosave file or files. If multiple files were open, Acrobat opens all of the files

for you.
3 Save the file or files with the same names as the files you were originally working on.

Reduce file size by saving
You can sometimes reduce the file size of a PDF simply by using the Save As Other command. Reducing the size of
PDFs improves their performance—particularly when they’re being opened on the web—without altering their
appearance.
The Reduce File Size command resamples and recompresses images, removes embedded Base-14 fonts, and subsetembeds fonts that were left embedded. It also compresses document structure and cleans up elements such as invalid
bookmarks. If the file size is already as small as possible, this command has no effect.
Note: Reducing the file size of a digitally signed document removes the signature.
1 Open a single PDF, or select one or more PDFs in a PDF Portfolio.
2 Choose File &amp;gt; Save As Other &amp;gt; Reduced Size PDF.
3 Select the version compatibility that you need.

If you’re certain that all your users use Acrobat DC or Adobe Acrobat Reader DC, limiting compatibility to the latest
version can further reduce file size.
4 (Optional) To apply the same settings to multiple files, click Apply To Multiple, and add the files. Click OK, then in

theOutput Options dialog box, specify your folder and filename preferences.

File format options for PDF export
When you export PDFs to different file formats using the Export PDF tool, each file format includes unique conversion
settings.
This document provides instructions for Acrobat DC. If you're using Acrobat Reader DC, see What can I do with Adobe
Reader. If you're using Acrobat XI, see Acrobat XI Help .

Adobe PDF options (Acrobat Pro DC)
You can resave PDFs as optimized PDFs, using settings in the PDF Optimizer dialog box. The PDF Optimizer lets you
change the compatibility version of your PDFs so they can be viewed using older versions of Acrobat DC or Acrobat
Reader DC. When you change the compatibility setting, newer features may be unavailable in the PDF. For an
explanation of each compatibility setting, see PDF compatibility levels.
If you want to use the same settings every time you convert PDFs to a particular format, specify those settings in the
Preferences dialog box. In the Convert From PDF panel, select a file format from the list and click Edit Settings. (Click
the Restore Defaults button at any time to revert to the default settings.)

Image conversion settings

JPEG and JPEG 2000 options
If your PDF contains a collection of images, you can export them individually as JPEG, PNG, or TIFF files by choosing
Tools &amp;gt; Export PDF &amp;gt; Image &amp;gt; Export All Images.
Note that the options available depend on whether you are exporting a document to JPEG or JPEG 2000.
Grayscale/Color Specifies a compression setting that balances file size with image quality. The smaller the file, the lesser
the image quality.
Tile Size Divides the image being compressed into tiles of the given size. (If the image height or width is not an even

multiple of the tile size, partial tiles are used on the edges.) Image data for each tile is individually compressed and can
be individually decompressed. The default value of 256 is recommended. This option is available only for JPEG 2000
format.
Format Determines how the file is displayed. Available only for JPEG format.
Baseline (Standard) Displays the image when it has fully downloaded. This JPEG format is recognizable to most web

browsers.
Baseline (Optimized) Optimizes color quality of the image and produces smaller file sizes but is not supported by all

web browsers.
Progressive (3 scans-5 scans) Downloads the image first as a low-resolution image, with incremental quality
improvements as downloading continues.
RGB/CMYK/Grayscale Specifies the type of color management to be applied to the output file and whether to embed an

ICC profile.
Note: If you use the Export To or Export All Images command on a PDF that contains JPEG and JPEG 2000 images, and
export the content to JPEG or JPEG 2000 format, the resulting image may look different when opened in Acrobat DC. This
can happen if the images have a color profile included at the page level but not inside the image data. In this case, Acrobat
DC cannot bring the page-level color profile into the resulting saved image.
Colorspace/Resolution Specifies a color space and resolution for the output file. You can let Acrobat determine these

settings automatically. To convert color images in the file to shades of gray, choose Grayscale.
Note: Higher resolutions, such as 2400 pixels per inch (ppi), are suitable only for small page sizes (up to 6.826 inches or
173.380 millimeters).

PNG options
PNG format is useful for images that will be used on the web.
Interlace Specifies if the image is interlaced. None creates an image that displays in a web browser only after
downloading is complete. Adam7 creates an image that displays low-resolution versions in a browser while the full
image file is downloading. Adam7 can make downloading time seem shorter and assures viewers that downloading is
in progress; however, it increases file size.
Filter Lets you select a filtering algorithm.
None Compresses the image without a filter. Recommended for indexed-color and bitmap-mode images.
Sub Optimizes the compression of images with even horizontal patterns or blends.
Up Optimizes the compression of images with even vertical patterns.
Average Optimizes the compression of low-level noise by averaging the color values of adjacent pixels.
Paeth Optimizes the compression of low-level noise by reassigning adjacent color values.

Last updated 5/10/2016

Saving and exporting PDFs

Adaptive Applies the filtering algorithm—Sub, Up, Average, or Paeth—best suited for the image. Select Adaptive if you

are unsure of which filter to use.
RGB/Grayscale Specifies the type of color management for the output file and whether to embed an ICC profile.
Colorspace/Resolution Specifies a color space and resolution for the output file. You can let Acrobat determine these
settings automatically. To convert color images in the file to shades of gray, choose Grayscale.

Note: Higher resolutions, such as 2400 ppi, are suitable only for small page sizes (up to 6.826 inches or 173.380 millimeters).

TIFF options
TIFF is a flexible bitmap image format supported by virtually all paint, image-editing, and page-layout applications.
Resolution is determined automatically.
Monochrome Specifies a compression format. CCITTG4 is the default and generally produces the smallest file size. ZIP
compression also produces a small file.

Note: Some applications cannot open TIFF files that are saved with JPEG or ZIP compression. In these cases, LZW
compression is recommended.
RGB/CMYK/Grayscale/Other Specifies the type of color management for the output file.
Colorspace/Resolution Specifies a color space and resolution for the output file. You can let Acrobat determine these
settings automatically. To convert color images in the file to shades of gray, choose Grayscale.

Note: Higher resolutions, such as 2400 ppi, are suitable only for small page sizes (up to 6.826 inches or 173.380 millimeters).

Microsoft Word &amp; RTF options
You can export a PDF to Word format (DOCX or DOC) or Rich Text Format (RTF). The following options are
available.
Retain Flowing Text
Specifies that text flow must be retained.
Retain Page Layout
Specifies that page layout must be retained.
Include Comments
Exports comments to the output file.
Include Images

removed from the HTML files.
Recognize Text If Needed Recognizes text if the PDF contains images that contain text.
Set Language Specifies the language setting for OCR.

Spreadsheet options
Excel Workbook Settings Specifies whether to create a Worksheet for each table or page, or the entire document.
Numeric Settings Specifies the decimal and thousands separators for numeric data. Select one of the following:

• Detect decimal and thousands separators using regional settings
• Treat the following as decimal and thousands separators. Enter or choose separators in the respective fields.
Recognize Text If Needed Recognizes text if the PDF contains images that contain text.
Set Language Specifies the language setting for OCR.

PostScript or Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) options
You can export a PDF to PostScript® for use in printing and prepress applications. The PostScript file includes full DSC
(Document Structuring Conventions) comments and other advanced information preserved by Adobe Acrobat
Distiller®. You can also create an EPS file from any PDF for placement or opening in other applications. The options
available depend on whether you are converting a document to PostScript or EPS.
Note: If you are creating EPS files for separations in Acrobat Pro DC, all image color spaces should be CMYK.
Printer Description File ThePostScript Printer Description (PPD) provides the necessary information to format a

PostScript file correctly for a particular output device. Device Independent creates only composite (not colorseparated) PostScript or EPS files. Acrobat Default provides a starting point and reference for creating all types of
PostScript and restores all default settings for the conversion. Adobe PDF 7.0 is compatible with most devices. This
option is available only for PostScript (PS) format.
ASCII or Binary Specifies the output format of image data. Binary output yields smaller files, but not all workflows can
accommodate binary output.
PostScript Specifies the level of PostScript compatibility. Use Language Level 3 only if the target output device supports
it. Language Level 2 is suitable for EPS files that will be placed in another document and color-separated as part of that
document. Use Language Level 2 for EPS files that you import into Microsoft applications.

Font Inclusion Specifies the fonts to be included in the PostScript. Embedded fonts are taken from the PDF; the

referenced fonts are taken from the computer in use.
Include Comments Preserves the appearance of comments in the resulting PostScript file.
Convert True Type to Type 1 Converts TrueType fonts to Type 1 fonts in the resulting PostScript file.
Include Preview Specifies if a TIFF preview is created for the resulting EPS file. This option is not available when saving

as PostScript.
Page Range Specifies the pages you want to export. When you export files to EPS output, each page in the range is
saved as a separate EPS file.

Text and XML options
Encoding Refers to the binary values, based on international standards, used to represent the text characters. UTF-8 is

a Unicode representation of characters using one or more 8-bit bytes per character; UTF-16 represents characters using
16-bit bytes. ISO-Latin-1 is an 8-bit representation of characters that is a superset of ASCII. UCS-4 is a Universal
Character Set coded in 4 octets. HTML/ASCII is a 7-bit representation of characters developed by ANSI.
Use Mapping Table Default uses the default character encoding defined in mapping tables, which appear in the Plugins/SaveAsXML/MappingTables folder. These mapping tables specify many characteristics of how the data is output,
including the following default character encodings: UTF-8 (Save as XML or HTML 4.0.1) and HTML/ASCII (Save as
HTML 3.2).
Generate Bookmarks Generates bookmark links to content for HTML or XML documents. Links are placed at the

beginning of the resulting HTML or XML document.
Generate Tags For Untagged Files Generates tags for files that are not already tagged, such as PDFs created using
Acrobat 4.0 or earlier. If this option is not selected, untagged files are not converted.

Note: Tags are applied only as part of the conversion process and are discarded after the conversion. This is not a method
for creating tagged PDFs from legacy files
Generate Images Controls how images are converted. Converted image files are referenced from within XML and

HTML documents.
Use Sub-Folder Specifies the folder in which to store generated images. The default is Images.
Use Prefix Specifies the prefix added to the image filenames if you have several versions of the same image file.

Filenames assigned to images have the format filename_img_#.
Output Format Specifies the final format of images. The default is JPG.
Downsample To Downsamples image files to the specified resolution. If you do not select this option, image files have
the same resolution as in the source file. Image files are never upsampled.

Chapter 9: Security

Enhanced security setting for PDFs
PDFs have evolved from static pages to complex documents with features such as interactive forms, multimedia
content, scripting, and other capabilities. These features leave PDFs vulnerable to malicious scripts or actions that can
damage your computer or steal data. Enhanced security lets you protect your computer against these threats by
blocking or selectively permitting actions for trusted locations and files.
When enhanced security is enabled and a PDF tries to complete a restricted action from an untrusted location or file,
a security warning appears. The type of warning depends on the action and your version of Acrobat or Reader. (See
Security warnings .)
For technical details about enhanced security, primarily for administrators, see the documents at
www.adobe.com/go/learn_acr_appsecurity_en.

Enable enhanced security
Acrobat and Reader X, 9.3, and 8.2 enable enhanced security by default. Adobe recommends that you enable enhanced
security if it is not already enabled, and that you bypass restrictions only for trusted content.
1 Choose Preferences.
2 From the Categories on the left, select Security (Enhanced).
3 Select the Enable Enhanced Security option.
4 (Optional—Windows only) Select Cross Domain Log File for troubleshooting problems if your workflow involves

cross-domain access using a server-based policy file.

Bypass enhanced security restrictions
With enhanced security enabled, only the files, folders, and locations that have been trusted are exempt from enhanced
security’s restrictions. You can specify trusted locations and files in several ways, depending on the action the PDF is
attempting to complete.

• Use the privileged locations feature in the Enhanced Security panel to trust files, folders, and host domains (root
URLs).
• Configure Internet access using the Trust Manager. (See URL settings .)
• For certified PDFs, trust the signer’s certificate for privileged network operations, such as networking, printing, and
file access. (See Set the trust level of a certificate.)
• Control cross-domain access using a server-based policy file. (See the Cross Domain Security document at
www.adobe.com/go/learn_acr_appsecurity_en.)

Security

Specify privileged locations for trusted content
Enhanced security provides a way to specify locations for trusted content. These privileged locations can be single files,
folders, or host domains (root URLs). Content that resides in a privileged location is trusted. For example, enhanced
security normally blocks PDFs from loading data from unknown websites. If you add the data’s origin (its host domain)
to your list of privileged locations, Acrobat and Reader allow loading the data. For details, see the Enhanced Security
document at www.adobe.com/go/learn_acr_appsecurity_en.
1 Select Preferences &amp;gt; Security (Enhanced).
2 Select the Enable Enhanced Security option.
3 Specify a list of locations in the Privileged Locations section, and then click OK.

• To trust any sites you already trust in Internet Explorer, select Automatically Trust Sites From My Win OS
Security Zones.
• To add only one or two PDFs from a location, click Add File.
• To create a trusted folder for multiple PDFs, click Add Folder Path or Add Host.
• To allow data to load from a website, enter the name of the root URL. For example, enter www.adobe.com, but
not www.adobe.com/products. To trust files from secure connections only, select Secure Connections Only
(https:).

Cross-domain access
Enhanced security prevents a PDF in one host domain from communicating with another domain. This action prevents
a PDF from getting malicious data from an untrusted source. When a PDF attempts cross-domain access, Acrobat and
Reader automatically attempt to load a policy file from that domain. If the domain of the document that is attempting
to access the data is included in the policy file, then the data is automatically accessible.
For more details, see the Application Security Guide at www.adobe.com/go/learn_acr_appsecurity_en.

Securing PDFs with passwords
This document provides instructions for Acrobat DC. If you're using Acrobat Reader DC, see What can I do with Adobe
Reader. If you're using Acrobat XI, see Acrobat XI Help . And, if you're using Acrobat 8, 9, or 10, see previous versions
of Acrobat Help.

Password security basics
Note: For a full list of articles about security, see Overview of security in Acrobat DC and PDFs.
You can limit access to a PDF by setting passwords and by restricting certain features, such as printing and editing.
However, you cannot prevent saving copies of a PDF. The copies have the same restrictions as the original PDF. Two
types of passwords are available:
Document open password A Document Open password (also known as a user password) requires a user to type a

password to open the PDF.
Permissions password A permissions password (also known as a master password) requires a password to change

permission settings. Using a permissions password, you can restrict printing, editing, and copying content in the PDF.

Last updated 5/10/2016

337
Security

Recipients don’t need a password to open the document in Reader or Acrobat. They do need a password to change the
restrictions you've set.
If the PDF is secured with both types of passwords, it can be opened with either password. However, only the
permissions password allows the user to change the restricted features. Because of the added security, setting both types
of passwords is often beneficial.
Note: You cannot add passwords to a signed or certified document.

Add a password to a PDF
1 Open the PDF and choose Tools &amp;gt; Protect &amp;gt; Encrypt &amp;gt; Encrypt with Password.
2 If you receive a prompt, click Yes to change the security.
3 Select Require A Password To Open The Document, then type the password in the corresponding field. For each

keystroke, the password strength meter evaluates your password and indicates the password strength.

4 Select an Acrobat version from the Compatibility drop-down menu. Choose a version equal to or lower than the

recipients’ version of Acrobat or Reader.

The Compatibility option you choose determines the type of encryption used. It is important to choose a version
compatible with the recipient's version of Acrobat or Reader. For example, Acrobat 7 cannot open a PDF encrypted
for Acrobat X and later.

• Acrobat 6.0 And Later (PDF 1.5) encrypts the document using 128-bit RC4.
• Acrobat 7.0 And Later (PDF 1.6) encrypts the document using the AES encryption algorithm with a 128-bit key
size.
• Acrobat X And Later (PDF 1.7) encrypts the document using 256-bit AES. To apply 256-bit AES encryption to
documents created in Acrobat 8 and 9, select Acrobat X And Later.

Encrypt All Document Contents Except Metadata Encrypts the contents of a document but still allows search

engines access to the document metadata.
Note: The iFilter and the Find or Advance Search commands of Acrobat do not look into the PDF’s metadata even when
you select the Encrypt All Document Contents Except Metadata option. You can use a search tool that takes
advantage of XMP metadata.
Encrypt Only File Attachments Requires a password to open file attachments. Users can open the document without

Restrict editing of a PDF
You can prevent users from changing PDFs. The Restrict Editing option prohibits users from editing text, moving
objects, or adding form fields. Users can still fill in form fields, sign, or add comments.
1 Open the PDF and choose Tools &amp;gt; Protect &amp;gt; Restrict Editing.
2 If you receive a prompt, click Yes to change the security.
3 Type the password in the corresponding field. For each keystroke, the password strength meter evaluates your

password and indicates the password strength.

4 Click OK, and then save the PDF to apply the restrictions.

Restrict printing, editing, and copying
You can prevent users from printing, editing, or copying content in a PDF. You can set the restrictions you want to apply
to the PDF. Users cannot change these restrictions unless you give them password.
Illustrator, Photoshop, or InDesign do not have view-only modes. To open a restricted PDF in these applications, the
user must enter the permissions password.
Note: If you forget a password, you cannot recover it from the PDF. Consider keeping a backup copy of the PDF that isn’t
password-protected.
1 Open the PDF and choose Tools &amp;gt; Protect &amp;gt; Encrypt &amp;gt; Encrypt with Password.
2 If you receive a prompt, click Yes to change the security.
3 Select Restrict Editing And Printing Of The Document.

All Adobe products enforce the restrictions set by the permissions password. However, if third-party products do
not support these settings, document recipients are able to bypass some or all of the restrictions you set.

About digital IDs

What is a digital ID?
A digital ID is like an electronic driver’s license or passport that proves your identity. A digital ID usually contains your
name and email address, the name of the organization that issued it, a serial number, and an expiration date. Digital
IDs are used for certificate security and digital signatures.
Digital IDs contain two keys: the public key locks, or encrypts data; the private key unlocks, or decrypts that data. When
you sign PDFs, you use the private key to apply your digital signature. The public key is in a certificate that you distribute
to others. For example, you can send the certificate to those who want to validate your signature or identity. Store your
digital ID in a safe place, because it contains your private key that others can use to decrypt your information.
Why do I need one?
You don’t need a digital ID for most of the work you do in PDFs. For example, you don’t need a digital ID to create
PDFs, comment on them, and edit them. You need a digital ID to sign a document or encrypt PDFs through a
certificate.
How do I get one?
You can get a digital ID from a third-party provider, or you can create a self-signed digital ID.
Self-signed digital IDs
Self-signed digital IDs can be adequate for personal use or small-to-medium businesses. Their use should be limited to
parties that have established mutual trust.
IDs from certificate authorities
Most business transactions require a digital ID from a trusted third-party provider, called a certificate authority.
Because the certificate authority is responsible for verifying your identity to others, choose one that is trusted by major
companies doing business on the Internet. The Adobe website gives the names of Adobe security partners that offer
digital IDs and other security solutions. See Adobe Approved Trust List members.

Create a self-signed digital ID
Sensitive transactions between businesses generally require an ID from a certificate authority rather than a self-signed
one.
1 Choose Edit &amp;gt; Preferences &amp;gt; Signatures.
2 Select Identities &amp; Trusted Certificates and click More.
3 Select Digital IDs on the left, and then click the Add ID button

.

4 Select the option A New Digital ID I Want To Create Now, and click Next.
5 Specify where to store the digital ID, and click Next.
New PKCS#12 Digital ID File Stores the digital ID information in a file, which has the extension .pfx in Windows and

.p12 in Mac OS. You can use the files interchangeably between operating systems. If you move a file from one
operating system to another, Acrobat still recognizes it.
Windows Certificate Store (Windows only) Stores the digital ID to a common location from where other Windows

applications can also retrieve it.
6 Type a name, email address, and other personal information for your digital ID. When you certify or sign a

document, the name appears in the Signatures panel and in the Signature field.
7 Choose an option from the Key Algorithm menu. The 2048-bit RSA option offers more security than 1024-bit RSA,

but 1024-bit RSA is more universally compatible.
8 From the Use Digital ID For menu, choose whether you want to use the digital ID for signatures, data encryption,

or both.
9 Type a password for the digital ID file. For each keystroke, the password strength meter evaluates your password

and indicates the password strength using color patterns. Reconfirm your password.
You can export and send your certificate file to contacts who can use it to validate your signature.
Note: Make a backup copy of your digital ID file. If your digital ID file is lost or corrupted, or if you forget your password,
you cannot use that profile to add signatures.

and timeout at the file level.
Note: Self-signed digital IDs expire in five years. After the expiration date, you can use the ID to open, but not sign or
encrypt, a document.
1 Choose Edit &amp;gt; Preferences &amp;gt; Signatures. In Identities &amp; Trusted Certificates, and click More.
2 Expand Digital IDs on the left, select Digital ID Files, and then select a digital ID on the right.
3 Click Change Password. Type the old password and a new password. For each keystroke, the password strength

meter evaluates your password and indicates the password strength using color patterns. Confirm the new
password, and then click OK.
4 With the ID still selected, click the Password Timeout button.
5 Specify how often you want to be prompted for a password:
Always Prompts you each time you use the digital ID.
After Lets you specify an interval.
Once Per Session Prompts you once each time you open Acrobat.
Never You’re never prompted for a password.

6 Type the password, and click OK.

Be sure to back up your password in a secure place. If you lose your password, either create a new self-signed digital ID
and delete the old one, or purchase one from a third-party provider.

Delete your digital ID
When you delete a digital ID in Acrobat, you delete the actual PKCS #12 file that contains both the private key and the
certificate. Before you delete your digital ID, ensure that it isn’t in use by other programs or required by any documents
for decrypting.
Note: You can delete only self-signed digital IDs that you created in Acrobat. A digital ID obtained from another provider
cannot be deleted.

Protecting digital IDs
By protecting your digital IDs, you can prevent unauthorized use of your private keys for signing or decrypting
confidential documents. Ensure that you have a procedure in place in the event your digital ID is lost or stolen.

How to protect your digital IDs
When private keys are stored on hardware tokens, smart cards, and other hardware devices that are password- or PINprotected, use a strong password or PIN. Never divulge your password to others. If you must write down your password,
store it in a secure location. Contact your system administrator for guidelines on choosing a strong password. Keep
your password strong by following these rules:

• Use eight or more characters.
• Mix uppercase and lowercase letters with numbers and special characters.
• Choose a password that is difficult to guess or hack, but that you can remember without having to write it down.
•

Do not use a correctly spelled word in any language, as they are subject to “dictionary attacks” that can crack these
passwords in minutes.

• Change your password on a regular basis.
• Contact your system administrator for guidelines on choosing a strong password.
To protect private keys stored in P12/PFX files, use a strong password and set your password timeout options
appropriately. If using a P12 file to store private keys that you use for signing, use the default setting for password
timeout option. This setting ensures that your password is always required. If using your P12 file to store private keys
that are used to decrypt documents, make a backup copy of your private key or P12 file. You can use the backed up
private key of P12 file to open encrypted documents if you lose your keys.
The mechanisms used to protect private keys stored in the Windows certificate store vary depending on the company
that has provided the storage. Contact the provider to determine how to back up and protect these keys from
unauthorized access. In general, use the strongest authentication mechanism available and create a strong password or
PIN when possible.

What to do if a digital ID is lost or stolen
If your digital ID was issued by a certificate authority, immediately notify the certificate authority and request the
revocation of your certificate. In addition, you should not use your private key.
If your digital ID was self-issued, destroy the private key and notify anyone to whom you sent the corresponding public
key (certificate).

Smart cards and hardware tokens
A smart card looks like a credit card and stores your digital ID on an embedded microprocessor chip. Use the digital
ID on a smart card to sign and decrypt documents on computers that can be connected to a smart card reader. Some
smart card readers include a keypad for typing a personal identification number (PIN).
Similarly, a security hardware token is a small, keychain-sized device that you can use to store digital IDs and
authentication data. You can access your digital ID by connecting the token to a USB port on your computer or mobile
device.

Securing PDFs with certificates
Note: For a full list of articles about security, see Overview of security in Acrobat DC and PDF content .

Certificate security
Use certificates to encrypt documents and to verify a digital signature. A digital signature assures recipients that the
document came from you. Encryption ensures that only the intended recipient can view the contents. A certificate
stores the public key component of a digital ID. For more information about digital IDs, see Digital IDs.
When you secure a PDF using a certificate, you specify the recipients and define the file access level for each recipient
or group. For example, you can allow one group to sign and fill forms and another to edit text or remove pages. You can
choose certificates from your list of trusted identities, files on disk, LDAP server, or the Windows certificate store
(Windows only). Always include your certificate in the recipient list so that you can open the document later.
Note: If possible, encrypt documents using certificates from third-party digital IDs. If the certificate is lost or stolen, the
issuing authority can replace it. If a self-signed digital ID is deleted, all PDFs that were encrypted using the certificate from
that ID are inaccessible forever.

Encrypt a PDF or PDF Portfolio with a certificate
To encrypt many PDFs, use Action Wizard in Acrobat Pro DC (Tools &amp;gt; Action Wizard) to apply a predefined sequence.
Alternatively, edit a sequence to add the security features you want. You can also save your certificate settings as a
security policy and reuse it to encrypt PDFs.
Note: For PDF Portfolios, Action Wizard applies security to the component PDFs but not to the PDF Portfolio itself. To
secure the entire PDF Portfolio, apply security to the portfolio’s cover sheet.
1 For a single PDF or a component PDF in a PDF Portfolio, open the PDF. For a PDF Portfolio, open the PDF Portfolio

and choose View &amp;gt; Portfolio &amp;gt; Cover Sheet.
2 Choose Tools &amp;gt; Protect &amp;gt; Encrypt &amp;gt; Encrypt with Certificate. If you don’t see the Protection panel, see the

instructions for adding panels at Task panes .
3 At the prompt, click Yes.
4 In the Certificate Security Settings dialog box, select the document components to encrypt.
5 From the Encryption Algorithm menu, choose a rate of encryption, and then click Next.

The encryption algorithm and key size are version-specific. Recipients must have the corresponding version (or
later) of Acrobat or Reader to decrypt and read the document.

• If you select 128-bit AES, recipients must have Acrobat 7 or later or Reader 7 or later to open the document.

Sharing certificates with others
Businesses that use certificates for secure workflows often store certificates on a directory server that participants can
search to expand their list of trusted identities.
When you receive a certificate from someone, you can add it to your list of trusted identities. You can set your trust
settings to trust all digital signatures and certified documents created with a specific certificate. You can also import
certificates from a certificate store, such as the Windows certificate store. A certificate store often contains numerous
certificates issued by different certification authorities.
For complete information on sharing certificates, see the Digital Signatures Guide (PDF) at
www.adobe.com/go/learn_acr_security_en.
Note: Third-party security providers usually validate identities by using proprietary methods. Or, they integrate their
validation methods with Acrobat. If you use a third-party security provider, see the documentation for the third-party
provider.

Get certificates from other users
Certificates that you receive from others are stored in a list of trusted identities. This list resembles an address book and
enables you to validate the signatures of these users on any documents you receive from them.

Add a certificate from email

1 Double-click the email attachment, then click Set Contact Trust in the dialog box that appears.
2 Select the contact and click Import.
3 Supply any password required and click Next. Click OK to view the import details, and then click OK again.
4 Choose the location and click Next. Then click Finish.
5 Click Set Contact Trust again to see that the contact has been added to Certificates. Select the certificate to view

Details and Trust information.

• For Trust, select the options desired.
• Use This Certificate As A Trusted Root only if it is required to validate a digital signature. Once you make a
certificate a trust anchor, you prevent revocation checking on it (or any certificate in the chain).
• To allow actions that can be a security risk, click Certified Documents, and then select the options you want to

Windows Explorer. To import certificates, identify the file that contains the certificates, and determine the file location.
1 In Windows Explorer, right-click the certificate file and choose Install PFX.
2 Follow the onscreen instructions to add the certificate to the Windows certificate store.
3 If you are prompted to validate the certificate before installing it, note the MD5 digest and SHA1 digest values

(fingerprint). Contact the originator of the certificate to confirm that the values are correct before you trust the
certificate. Click OK.

Verify information on a certificate
The Certificate Viewer dialog box provides user attributes and other information about a certificate. When others
import your certificate, they often want to check your fingerprint information against the information they receive with
the certificate. (The fingerprint refers to the MD5 digest and SHA1 digest values.) You can check certificate information
for your digital ID files or the ID files that you import.
For more information about verifying certificates, see the Digital Signatures User Guide (PDF) at
www.adobe.com/go/learn_acr_security_en.
The Certificate Viewer dialog box provides the following information:

• Certificate validation period
• Intended use of the certificate
• Certificate data, such as the serial number and public key method
You can also check if the certificate authority has revoked the certificate. Certificates are typically revoked when an
employee leaves the company or when security is compromised in some way.

PDF and flattens remaining layers into a single layer. To view layers, choose View &amp;gt; Show/Hide &amp;gt; Navigation Panes &amp;gt;
Layers.
Embedded Search Index
An embedded search index speeds up searches in the PDF file. To determine if the PDF contains a search index, choose
Tools &amp;gt; Index and then click Manage Embedded Index in the secondary toolbar. Removing indexes decreases file size
but increases search time for the PDF.
Deleted Or Cropped Content
PDFs sometimes retain content that has been removed and no longer visible, such as cropped or deleted pages, or
deleted images.

Font Size Displays custom text in the selected point size.
Auto-Size Text To Fit Redaction Region Resizes custom text to fit within the redacted area. When selected, this option

overrides the Font Size setting for the overlay text.
Font Color Displays custom text in the selected color, which you can change by clicking the color swatch.
Repeat Overlay Text Fills the redacted area with as many instances of the custom text as needed, without changing the
font size. For example, if you specify the letter x or a hyphen (-) as the custom text, these characters are repeated
throughout the redacted area.
Text Alignment Aligns text to the left, right, or center.

Redaction codes (Acrobat Pro DC)
Acrobat uses overlay text to overprint areas selected for redaction. One example of overlay text is a redaction code,
which consists of one or more code entries from a code set. Acrobat includes the U.S. FOIA and U.S. Privacy Act code
sets that you can use. You can use either codes or custom text to create overlay text. The difference is that redaction
codes are text entries that you can save, export, and import. One code set can contain multiple codes.
Note: Codes don’t save the current attributes for overlay text as part of the code definition, such as colors, font
characteristics, and repetition or size of text. Codes only make the overlay text itself reusable in future sessions and by other
users with whom you share code sets. You set other attributes for the code in the Redaction Tool Properties dialog box.

Security

Types of security policies
If you often apply the same security settings to multiple PDFs, you can save your settings as a policy that you can reuse.
Security policies save time while ensuring a consistently secure workflow. Creating policies for password and certificate
security lets you reuse the same security settings for any number of PDFs. Two kinds of security policies are available:

• Organizational policies are especially useful if you want others to have access to PDFs for a limited time. Adobe
LiveCycleRights Management ES policies are stored on a server. Users must have access to the server to use these
policies. Creating these policies requires specifying the document recipients from a list on Adobe LiveCycleRights
Management ES. Adobe LiveCycleRights Management ES controls access to PDFs and auditing events as defined by
the security policy. You can use Adobe LiveCycleRights Management ES if your company has licensed the software
and made it available to you.
• User policies are created and applied by individuals. If you apply the same security settings to numerous documents,
you can save time by creating a user policy. Then, apply the user policy to documents. User policies for passwords
and public key certificates are stored on your local computer. With access to Adobe LiveCycleRights Management
ES, you can create a user policy that’s stored on Adobe LiveCycleRights Management ES. That policy is available only
to you.

How organizational policies are authenticated
In addition to reusing security settings, policies stored on Adobe LiveCycleRights Management ES enable you to expire
and revoke documents. You can also maintain accountability by auditing users who open protected documents.

A Policies are stored on server. B Policies are applied to a PDF. C Users can open, edit, and print a document only if permitted by policy.

Setting up server-based security policies involves four main stages:
Configure the Adobe LiveCycleRights Management ES The system administrator of your company or group usually

configures Adobe LiveCycleRights Management ES, manages accounts, and sets up organizational policies. For more
information on configuringAdobe LiveCycleRights Management ES, see the Adobe website.
Publish a document with a security policy An author creates a PDF and applies a policy stored on Adobe LiveCycle

Rights Management ES to the PDF. The server generates a license and unique encryption key for the PDF. Acrobat
embeds the license in the PDF and encrypts it using the encryption key. The author or administrator can use this license
to track and audit the PDF.
View a document with a policy applied When users try to open the secure PDF in Acrobat 9 (or Reader 9), they must
authenticate their identities. If the user is granted access to the PDF, the PDF is decrypted and opens with the
permissions specified in the policy.
Administer events and modify access By logging in to an Adobe LiveCycleRights Management ES account, the author
or administrator can track events and change access to policy-secured PDFs. Administrators can view all PDF and
system events, modify configuration settings, and change access to policy-secured PDFs.

Security

Create a user security policy
User policies can use passwords, certificates, or Adobe LiveCycleRights Management ES to authenticate documents.
The policies for password and certificate security can be stored on a local computer. Security policies created using
Adobe LiveCycleRights Management ES are stored on a server. You can audit actions and change security settings
dynamically. You can use Adobe LiveCycleRights Management ES if your company has licensed the software and made
it available to you.

Creating policies for secure file attachments
You can add security to one or more documents by embedding them in a security envelope and sending it as an email
attachment. This method is useful if you want to send a secure file attachment without encrypting the files. You can
embed the documents as file attachments in a security envelope, and encrypt and send the envelope to the recipients.
When the recipients open the envelope, they can extract the file attachments and save them. The saved files are identical
to the original file attachments and are no longer encrypted when saved.
For example, when you send confidential documents, including non-PDF files, you only want the recipient to view the
documents. You can embed these documents as attachments in a security envelope, encrypt the envelope, and send it
by email. Anyone can open the envelope, view its cover page, and even view a list of the contents. However, only the
recipient can view the embedded attachments and extract them.

1 Choose Tools &amp;gt; Protect &amp;gt; More Protection &amp;gt; Create Security Envelope. If you don’t see the Protection panel, see the

instructions for adding panels at Task panes .
2 Click Add File To Send, select the documents you want to attach, and then click Open. Click Next.
3 Select an envelope template, and click Next.
4 Select a delivery method, and click Next.
5 If an envelope policy has been created, select it or select New Policy. Then, follow the steps to create a policy.
6 Review the information and click Finish.
7 For some policies, you are asked to type the information you want displayed on the envelope. Enter enough

information to allow recipients to identify the sender of the envelope.
8 Complete the security information (password, certificate, or policy).
9 When the envelope is displayed, type the names of the recipients. Then, either click the Save or Mail icon in the

toolbar.
If you click the Mail icon, your default email program opens with the security envelope as an attachment. Type the
email addresses of the recipients, and send the email message.

Choosing a security method for PDFs
Note: For a full list of articles about security, see Overview of security in Acrobat DC and PDF content .
By adding security to documents, you can limit viewing, editing, printing, and other options to only the specified users.

Choosing which type of security to use
Security features range from relatively simple measures to sophisticated systems adopted by corporations and agencies.
Which feature you choose depends on what you want to achieve. Here are some examples:

• You want only certain people to view your PDF. The easiest solution is to add a password to the PDF and send it
to your intended recipients. (See Password security basics.)
• You don’t want anyone to print or edit your PDF. You can block printing and editing from the same dialog box
that you use to add a password. (See Password security basics.)
• You want to assure your recipients that the PDF is really from you. The best way is to purchase a digital ID from
a certificate authority. Alternatively, you can create a self-signed digital ID if you are communicating with a group
that you trust. (See About digital IDsand Securing documents with certificates .)
• You want an organization-wide security solution for PDFs. You can devise a solution specifically for a company
handling sensitive data. Some organizations use Adobe LiveCycle Rights Management ES to apply a policy to
documents. The policy contains the list of recipients and their individual set of permissions. Individuals can use a
policy to apply the same security settings to numerous documents. (See Securing documents with Adobe LiveCycle
Rights Management ES .)

Security policies
A security policy enforces systematic constraints on information flow and exchange within an organization. You can
use Adobe LiveCycleRights Management ES to apply a policy to documents without the need for digital signatures and
certificates. If you often apply the same security settings to PDFs, consider creating a security policy to simplify your
workflow. Different policies are useful for accommodating different requirements.
Envelope policy You can secure multiple documents by embedding them in a PDF envelope. You can encrypt

envelopes to prevent unauthorized users from accessing the contents and certify them to provide proof of origin.
Authorized recipients can open the envelope and extract the files to view them.
LiveCycle Rights Management ES policy Adobe LiveCycleRights Management ES policies are stored on a server, and
users must have access to the server to use them. Creating these policies requires specifying the document recipients
from a list on Adobe LiveCycleRights Management ES.
Password and certificate policies Save your password or certificate settings and reuse them to encrypt PDFs without
setting up the password or certificate for each instance.

If you apply security settings to a PDF Portfolio in Acrobat Pro DC, including the component documents, you can
automate the steps by using Action Wizard (Choose Tools &amp;gt;Action Wizard).
Protection required:

Action:

Require a password to open a PDF, or copy or print its contents

If your company is signed up, you can also use Adobe LiveCycle Rights
Management ES to secure documents.
When you use Action Wizard to apply security to PDF Portfolios in
Acrobat Pro DC, the child documents are secured, but the cover sheet
is not.

Indicate that you approve of the PDF content

Sign and certify the PDF. You must obtain a digital ID to add digital
signatures. Buy a digital ID (see the Adobe website for security

Choosing security methods within FIPS mode (Windows)
Acrobat and Reader provide a FIPS mode to restrict data protection to Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS).
FIPS mode uses FIPS 140-2 approved algorithms using the RSA BSAFE Crypto-C Micro Edition (ME) 3.0.0.1
cryptographic module.
The following security options are not available in FIPS mode:

• Applying password-based security policies to documents. You can use public key certificates or Adobe
LiveCycleRights Management ES to secure the document. However, you cannot use password encryption to secure
the document.
• Creating self-signed certificates. To create a self-signed digital ID, it must be saved to the Windows certificate store.
You cannot create a self-signed digital ID that is saved to a file.
• RC4 encryption. A PDF file can only be encrypted by using the AES encryption algorithm when in FIPS mode.
• MD5 or RIPEMD160 digest methods. In FIPS mode, only the SHA-1 and SHA-2 families of digest algorithms can
be used when creating a digital signature.
In FIPS mode, you can open and view documents that are protected with algorithms that are not FIPS compliant.
However, you can’t save any changes to the document using password security. To apply security policies to the
document, use either public key certificates or Adobe LiveCycleRights Management ES.
FIPS mode is configured in the Windows registry by a system administrator. For more information, see Digital
Signatures Guide (PDF) at www.adobe.com/go/learn_acr_security_en.

Security warnings when a PDF opens
You sometimes see a warning when you open a PDF. The warning comes in many forms (three are shown below).

Last updated 5/10/2016

366
Security

What does the warning mean?
The warning is asking whether you trust the people who sent you the PDF or the site in which the PDF is displayed.
The warning appears because the PDF content can potentially harm your computer. For example, the warning is
displayed for PDFs that can transfer or run programs and macros. It does not necessarily mean that the PDF is harmful.

What is the right action to take?
Some product features assign trust through their own Preferences panel. For example, the Trust Manager includes for
managing URL access, and Multimedia Trust (Legacy) has options for playing embedded multimedia. For features
affected when enhanced security is enabled, you can selectively allow restricted actions by using a method described in
Bypass enhanced security restrictions.
To open Preferences, choose Edit &amp;gt; Preferences (Windows) or Acrobat DC/Adobe Acrobat Reader DC &amp;gt; Preferences
(Mac OS).
If you know and trust the sender
If you trust the PDF or the company or individual who sent it, click the Options, Allow, or Play button. (The buttons
vary depending on the warning.) You can now view the PDF.
If you don’t know or trust the sender
If you don't trust the PDF or don't know who created it or where it came from, don't click the Options, Allow, or Play
button. Acrobat DC and Adobe Acrobat Reader DC continues to block the suspicious content or actions. To hide the
warning, click the Close or Cancel button. If you click any of the blocked content, the warning reappears.

No Options, Allow, or Play button?
If the warning does not contain an Options, Allow, or Play button, your administrator has disabled this feature. You
cannot choose to trust or allow this content. Click the Close or Cancel button to hide the warning. You can view the
PDF, but you cannot access any of the blocked content. Contact your administrator for more information.
Note: For a full list of articles about security, see Overview of security in Acrobat and PDF content .

When are security warnings displayed?
Security warnings can be displayed in the following situations:
Blacklisted JavaScript
JavaScript is a computer language in widespread use. JavaScript code can be vulnerable to attacks, and JavaScript can
be used to open websites. Adobe regularly updates the blacklist with known JavaScript vulnerabilities. If a PDF tries to
access blacklisted JavaScript, you see a message in the yellow document bar, at the top.
For administrators:

• For instructions on how to manage JavaScript execution, see the article JavaScripts in PDFs as a security risk
• For more information about the situations that trigger JavaScript warnings and blacklisted JavaScript, see
www.adobe.com/go/acroappsecurity.

Adobe periodically distributes certificates for security purposes. These downloads help ensure that digitally signed
PDFs from trusted sources maintain their trusted status. If you receive an update from an unknown source, verify that
it is from a web address that you trust before proceeding. Updates from untrusted websites can create vulnerabilities on
your computer.

Accessing stream objects (XObjects)
Acrobat and Reader display a warning when a PDF attempts to access external content identified as a stream object.
For example, a URL might point to an external image. The silent transmission of data can pose a security risk as Acrobat
and Reader communicate with an external source.

Inserting data into PDFs and forms
A warning appears when an untrusted source attempts to add data to a PDF form. Although this data-injection feature
can streamline workflows in your organization, it can also be used to add malicious data into a PDF.

Silent printing
Silent printing is printing to a file or printer without your confirmation. It is a potential security risk because a
malicious file can silently print multiple times to your printer, wasting printer resources. It can also prevent other
documents from printing by keeping the printer busy.
Contact your system administrator to determine when to allow silent printing.

Web links
In addition to visible web links in a PDF document, form fields can contain hidden JavaScript that open a page in a
browser or silently request data from the Internet.
Note: Acrobat and Reader X, 9.3, and 8.2 enable enhanced security by default. Adobe recommends that you enable
enhanced security if it is not already enabled, and bypass restrictions only for trusted content.

Protected View feature for PDFs (Windows only)
Note: For a full list of articles about security, see Overview of security in Acrobat and PDF content .
Protected View provides an additional level of security. When Protected View in enabled, PDFs are displayed in a
restricted environment called a sandbox. This isolation of the PDFs reduces the risk of security breaches in areas
outside the sandbox. Adobe strongly recommends that you use Acrobat DC in Protected View if you are concerned
about security, or if you frequently interact with PDFs on the Internet.
Adobe Acrobat Reader DC includes a similar restricted environment called Protected Mode. For information about
Reader Protected Mode, see Reader Help.

Security

When Protected View is enabled, only basic navigation is allowed. For example, you can open PDFs, scroll through
pages, and click links. You can enable Protected View in a PDF that you view in either stand-alone Acrobat DC or in a
web browser.
PDF in stand-alone Acrobat DC In Protected View, Acrobat DC displays a warning for a PDF that doesn’t originate

from a trusted location. The warning lets you decide whether to trust the document.
You can find out whether a PDF opened in a browser is in Protected View. Right-click the document in the browser and
choose Document Properties. Click the Advanced tab. When Protected View is enabled, the status says Protected Mode:
On.

Enable or disable Protected View
Unlike Protected Mode in Acrobat Reader DC, Protected View in Acrobat DC is off by default.
1 Choose Preferences.
2 From the Categories on the left, select Security (Enhanced).
3 Select the Enable Enhanced Security option.
4 Choose one of the following options:
Off Disables Protected View, if you have enabled it. Protected View is off by default.
Files From Potentially Unsafe Locations Enables Protected View and displays the warning for all files originating

from an untrusted location. Files and locations that you add to the Privileged Locations area of the Enhanced
Security panel are exempt from Protected View.
All files Enables Protected View in all PDFs that you open in either stand-alone Acrobat or in a browser.

Bypass Protected View restrictions
Choose any of these options:

• Select Off in the Enhanced Security panel of the Security (Enhanced) preferences.
• Add files, folders, and locations to the Privileged Locations area of the Enhanced Security panel. (See Specify

Overview of security in Acrobat DC and PDFs
Security applies in two general contexts: application (software) security and content security.
Application security involves customizing security features to protect Acrobat and Reader against vulnerabilities,
malicious attacks, and other risks. Advanced users can customize the application through the user interface. Enterprise
administrators can also configure the registry. See the following articles for details.
Content security involves the use of product features to protect the integrity of PDF content. These features safeguard
against the unwanted alteration of PDFs, keep sensitive information private, prevent the printing of PDFs, and so on.
See the following articles for details.
A related subject is digital signatures, meant to guarantee the identity of senders and recipients of PDFs. See Certificatebased signaturesfor a list of topics related to digital signatures.

Note: For a full list of articles about security, see Overview of security in Acrobat DC and PDF content .
Acrobat DC and Acrobat Reader DC let you adjust application behavior so that JavaScript executes within your desired
level of security. This helps restrict application access to JavaScript APIs and isolates workflows that do not require
JavaScript APIs.

Enable Acrobat JavaScript Uncheck to disable JavaScript completely or restrict JavaScript through APIs.
Enable Menu Items JavaScript Execution Privileges Enables executing JavaScript by clicking menu items. When off,
privileged JavaScript calls can be executed through the menu. Executing non-privileged JavaScript calls through
menu items is not blocked whether this box is checked or not.
Enable Global Object Security Policy Allows JavaScript globally through APIs, or trusts specific documents

containing JavaScripts.
Alternatively, you can modify your system registry settings to manage JavaScript execution.
For details, see the Application Security Guide at www.adobe.com/go/learn_acr_appsecurity_en.

Attachments as security risks in Acrobat Reader DC and
Acrobat DC
Note: For a full list of articles about security, see Overview of security in Acrobat and PDF content .
Attachments represent a potential security risk because they can contain malicious content, open other dangerous files,
or launch applications. Acrobat DC and Acrobat Reader DC always let you open and save PDF and FDF file
attachments. Acrobat DC and Acrobat Reader DC recognize certain files, such as those whose names end in .bin, .exe,
and .bat, as threats. You can’t attach such files. Acrobat DC does allow you to attach files that cannot be saved or opened
from Acrobat DC, such as ZIP files. However, this practice is not recommended.
Acrobat DC and Acrobat Reader DC maintain a white list of file types that can be opened or saved, and a black list of
file types that cannot. You are allowed to attach file types that are not on either list. However, when you open or save a
file of an “unrecognized” type, you see a dialog box asking whether you trust the file type.
For details, see the Application Security Guide at www.adobe.com/go/learn_acr_appsecurity_en.

Manually add a file type to a black or white list
Administrators can modify the black or white list through the registry. Users can manually add a new file type to a black
or white list by attaching the file and then trying to open it.
1 Choose Tools &amp;gt; Edit PDF &amp;gt; Attach A File.
2 Add a file type that is not in the black or white list.
3 Right-click the file in the Attachments pane on the left and choose Open Attachment.
4 In the Launch Attachment dialog box, select one of the following options, and then click OK:
Open This File: Opens the file without changing the registry list.
Always Allow Opening Files Of This Type: Adds the file type to the white list and prevents future warnings.
Never Allow Opening Files Of This Type: Adds the file type to the black list and does not open it. You can possibly

attach a file of this type to a PDF, but you can’t open it.
Note: To restrict a file type that you permitted in the past, reset (restore) attachment permissions in the Trust Manager
Preferences.

2 From the Categories on the left, select Trust Manager.
3 In the PDF Attachments panel, click Restore. The Restore button is available only if you changed the attachment

defaults.

Allow attachments to start applications
The Trust Manager lets you control whether non-PDF attachments can start their associated applications.
1 In the Preferences dialog box, select Trust Manager from the Categories on the left.
2 Select the option Allow Opening Of Non-PDF File Attachments With External Applications. You must have the

external applications to open the files.

Allow or block links to the Internetin PDFs
Note: For a full list of articles about security, see Overview of security in Acrobat and PDF content .
Clicking any link to the Internet poses a potential security risk. Malicious websites can transfer harmful content or
silently gather data. If you are concerned about these risks, you can configure Acrobat DC and Acrobat Reader DC to
display a warning when a PDF attempts to connect to an Internet site.
You can allow Acrobat DC and Acrobat Reader DC to contact selected websites by adding their addresses (URLs) to
your list of trusted websites in the Trust Manager preferences. Alternatively, you can allow all URLs.
Note: If the options in the Manage Internet Access dialog box are disabled, select Custom Setting. If options are still disabled,
your product could be under an administrator’s control with those restrictions in place.
1 Choose Edit &amp;gt; Preferences (Windows) or Acrobat DC/Acrobat Reader DC &amp;gt; Preferences (Mac OS).

Sign PDF documents
You can sign a document to attest to its contents or approve the document. Based on the intent, you use different types
of signatures.
This document provides instructions for Acrobat DC. If you're using Acrobat Reader, see What can I do with Adobe
Reader. If you're using Acrobat XI, see Acrobat XI Help . And, if you're using Acrobat 8, 9, or 10 see previous versions
of Acrobat Help.

Sign a PDF
To sign a PDF document or form, you can type, draw, or insert an image of your handwritten signature. You can also
add text, such as your name, company, title, or the date. When you save the document, the signature and text become
part of the PDF.
You can also capture a picture of your signature on mobile using Adobe Acrobat Reader DC mobile app and save it in
Adobe Document Cloud, so that it's synced and available for use across your desktop and other mobile devices. For more
information, see Capture your signature on mobile and use it everywhere.

About certificate signatures in Adobe Acrobat
Adobe Acrobat supports a range of solutions for electronic and digital signatures. These solutions include certificate
signatures that let you sign PDF files with a certificate-based digital ID. Certificate signatures are also known as digital
signatures. Acrobat lets you create your own certificate ID. However, the more common approach is to work with a
certificate ID that a trusted third-party certificate authority issued. Additional signing options in Acrobat include
integration with the Adobe Document Cloud eSign service.

Why use certificate signatures?
Many business transactions, including financial, legal, and other regulated transactions, require high assurance when
signing documents. When documents are distributed electronically, it is important that recipients can:

• Verify document authenticity—confirming the identity of each person who signed the document
• Verify document integrity—confirming that the document has not been altered in transit

Last updated 5/10/2016

379
Electronic signatures

Certificate-based signatures provide both of these security services. Many businesses and governments have chosen to
set up a certificate-based digital signature infrastructure within their organization. They use third-party certificate
authorities to provide independent identity validation. Examples include:

• Pharmaceutical companies who need to use signatures that comply with the SAFE (Signatures &amp; Authentication For
Everyone) BioPharma industry standard
• Companies in the European Union who need to comply with the ETSI PAdES standard (PDF Advanced Electronic
Signatures)

What can I do with certificate IDs?
Once certificate-based digital IDs have been provided to end users, they can use Acrobat or Adobe Reader software to
sign PDF files and validate files they receive from others.
Sign documents

• Sign PDF files using certificate IDs
• Place a signature box anywhere on the page
• Add multiple signatures to a page
• Add a time stamp to the document when working with a configured time stamp server
• Certify a document with a visible or hidden signature so that recipients can verify authenticity with or without
seeing a visible signature on the page
• Automatically embed certificate data to support long-term validation (new in Acrobat XI and Reader XI)
Validate documents

• Validate all signatures, confirming the identity of everyone who signed the document
• Validate document integrity by tracking all previously signed versions of a document to verify changes made during
the document’s lifecycle
Set privileges and permissions for others

• Certify a document while leaving portions of it available for form filling, signatures, or comments
• Use Acrobat Pro software to enable users of Reader 9 or later to sign with certificate IDs
• Use Acrobat Standard or Pro to encrypt a PDF document with a certificate ID to restrict usage such as printing,
editing, or copying

What if my organization isn’t prepared to set up certificate-based signatures?
Consider signing up for the Adobe Document Cloud eSign service online, the leader in e-signatures and web
contracting. With eSign, you can get PDF, Microsoft Word, and other documents sent, signed, and filed instantly. And
best of all, Adobe hosts it securely, so your IT department doesn’t have to do the work of setting up a signature
infrastructure.

Certificate-based signatures
A certificate-based signature, like a conventional handwritten signature, identifies the person signing a document.
Unlike a handwritten signature, a certificate-based signature is difficult to forge because it contains encrypted
information that is unique to the signer. It can be easily verified and informs recipients whether the document was
modified after the signer initially signed the document.
To sign a document with a certificate-based signature, you must obtain a digital ID or create a self-signed digital ID in
Acrobat or Adobe Reader. The digital ID contains a private key and a certificate with a public key and more. The private
key is used to create the certificate-based signature. The certificate is a credential that is automatically applied to the
signed document. The signature is verified when recipients open the document.
When you apply a certificate-based signature, Acrobat uses a hashing algorithm to generate a message digest, which it
encrypts using your private key. Acrobat embeds the encrypted message digest in the PDF, certificate details, signature
image, and a version of the document when it was signed.

Certifying and signing documents
The Sign &amp;gt; Work with Certificates panel lets you apply two types of certificate-based signatures. You can certify a
document attest to its content or approve a document with the Sign With Certificate option.
Certify Certify options provide a higher level of document control than Sign With Certificate. For documents that
require certification, you must certify the documents before others sign them. If a document has already been signed,
the Certify options are disabled. When you certify a document, you can control the types of changes other people can
make. You can certify with or without displaying a signature.
Sign With Certificate When you sign with a certificate, the signature is considered an approval signature.

Signatures made with the Certify or Sign With Certificate options comply with data protection standards specified by
the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). In addition, both signature types comply with the PDF
Advanced Electronic Signature (PAdES) standard. Acrobat and Reader provide an option to change the default signing
format to a CAdES format. This option is compliant with Part 3 of the PAdES standard. The timestamp capability and
native support for long-term validation of signatures (introduced in Acrobat 9.1) is in compliance with Part 4 of the
PAdES standard. The default signing format, when set up accordingly, is compliant with Part 2 of the PAdES standard.
You can change the default signing method or format, in the Signatures panel of the Preferences dialog box. Under
Creation &amp; Appearance, click More.

Setting up certificate-based signatures
You can expedite the signing process and optimize your results by making the following preparations in advance.
Note: Some situations require using particular digital IDs for signing. For example, a corporation or government agency
can require individuals to use only digital IDs issued by that agency to sign official documents. Inquire about the digital
signature policies of your organization to determine the appropriate source of your digital ID.

• Get a digital ID from your own organization, buy a digital ID (see the Adobe website for security partners), or create
a self-signed one. See Create a self-signed digital ID. You can’t apply a certificate-based signature without a digital id.
Note: You cannot create self-signed digital IDs from within FIPS mode.

• Set the default signing method.
• Create an appearance for your certificate-based signature. (See Create the appearance of a certificate-based
signature)
• Use Preview Document mode to suppress any dynamic content that can alter the appearance of the document and
mislead you into signing an unsuitable document. For information about using the Preview Document mode, see
Sign in Preview Document mode .
• Review all the pages in a document before you sign. Documents can contain signature fields on multiple pages.
• Configure the signing application. Both authors and signers should configure their application environment. (See
Set signing preferences)
For details on the full range of configuration options in enterprise settings, see the Digital Signatures Guide.

• Choose a signature type. Learn about approval and certification signatures to determine the type you should choose
to sign your document. (See Signature types.)

Set signing preferences
Signing workflow preferences control what you can see and do when the signing dialog box opens. You can allow
certain actions, hide and display data fields, and change how content affects the signing process. Setting signing
preferences impacts your ability to see what you are signing. For information on the available signing preferences, see
“Signing Workflow Preferences” in the Digital Signature Guide at www.adobe.com/go/learn_acr_security_en.

Customizing signature workflows using seed values
Seed values offer additional control to document authors by letting them specify which choices signers can make when
signing a document. By applying seed values to signature fields in unsigned PDFs, authors can customize options and
automate tasks. They can also specify signature requirements for items such as certificates and timestamp servers. For
more information about customizing signatures using seed values, see the Digital Signature Guide (PDF) at
www.adobe.com/go/learn_acr_security_en.

Create the appearance of a certificate-based signature
You determine the look of your certificate-based signature by selecting options in the Signatures panel of the
Preferences dialog box. For example, you can include an image of your handwritten signature, a company logo, or a
photograph. You can also create different signatures for different purposes. For some, you can provide a greater level of
detail.
A signature can also include information that helps others verify your signature, such as reason for signing, contact
information, and more.

5 Type the name and URL for the roaming ID server, and click Next.
6 Type your user name and password or follow the directions to create an account. Click Next, and then click Finish.

Once the roaming ID is added, it can be used for signing or encryption. When you perform a task that uses your
roaming ID, you’re automatically logged in to the roaming ID server if your authentication assertion hasn’t expired.

PKCS#12 modules and tokens
You can have multiple digital IDs that you use for different purposes, particularly if you sign documents in different
roles or using different certification methods. Digital IDs are usually password protected. They can be stored on your
computer in PKCS #12 file format. Digital IDs can also be stored on a smart card, hardware token, or in the Windows
certificate store. Roaming IDs can be stored on a server. Acrobat includes a default signature handler that can access
digital IDs from various locations. Register the digital ID in Acrobat for it to be available for use.

Store certificates on directory servers
Directory servers are commonly used as centralized repositories of identities within an organization. The server acts as
an ideal location to store user certificates in enterprises that use certificate encryption. Directory servers let you locate
certificates from network servers, including Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) servers. After you locate a
certificate, you can add it to your list of trusted identities so that you don’t have to look it up again. By developing a
storage area for trusted certificates, you or a member of your workgroup can facilitate the use of encryption in the
workgroup.
For more information about directory servers, see the Digital Signature Guide (PDF) at
www.adobe.com/go/learn_acr_security_en.

Import directory server settings (Windows only)
You import directory server settings using security import/export methodology or a security settings file. Before, you
import settings in a file using import/export methodology, ensure that you trust the file provider before opening it.
1 Open the Preferences dialog box.
2 Under Categories, select Signatures.
3 For Document TimeStamping, click More.

5 Select the import/export methodology file, and click Open.
6 If the file is signed, click the Signature Properties button to check the current signature status.
7 Click Import Search Directory Settings.
8 Click OK, if prompted, to confirm your choice.

The directory server appears in the Security Settings dialog box.

Export directory server settings (Windows only)
Although it is preferable to export security settings, you can export directory settings as an import/export methodology
file. Use the file to configure the directory server on another computer.
1 Open the Preferences dialog box.
2 Under Categories, select Identity.
3 Enter your name, organization, and email address to create your profile.

Note: See also Export security settings.

Add a timestamp to certificate-based signatures
You can include the date and time you signed the document as part of your certificate-based signature. Timestamps are
easier to verify when they are associated with a trusted timestamp authority certificate. A timestamp helps to establish
when you signed the document and reduces the chances of an invalid signature. You can obtain a timestamp from a
third-party timestamp authority or the certificate authority that issued your digital ID.
Timestamps appear in the signature field and in the Signature Properties dialog box. If a timestamp server is configured,
the timestamp appears in the Date/Time tab of the Signature Properties dialog box. If no timestamp server is
configured, the signatures field displays the local time of the computer at the moment of signing.
Note: If you did not embed a timestamp when you signed the document, you can add one later to your signature. (See
Establish long-term signature validation.) A timestamp applied after signing a document uses the time provided by the
timestamp server.

Configure a timestamp server
To configure a timestamp server, you need the server name and the URL, which you can obtain from an administrator
or a security settings file.
If you have a security settings file, install it and don’t use the following instructions for configuring a server. Ensure that
you obtained the security settings file from a trusted source. Don’t install it without checking with your system
administration or IT department.
1 Open the Preferences dialog box.
2 Under Categories, select Signatures.
3 For Document Timestamping, click More.
4 Select Time Stamp Servers on the left.
5 Do one of the following:

• If you have an import/export methodology file with the timestamp server settings, click the Import button
Select the file, and click Open.

.

• If you have a URL for the timestamp server, click the New button
. Type a name, and then type the server
URL. Specify whether the server requires a user name and password, and then click OK.

Adobe LiveCycle Rights Management (ALCRM) servers
Adobe LiveCycleRights Management (ALCRM) servers let you define centralized policies to control access to
documents. The policies are stored on the ALCRM server. You require server access to use them.
ALCRM servers embed user access information in documents. Therefore, specify document recipients in ALCRM
policies. Alternatively, let the ALCRM server retrieve the list of recipients from LDAP directories.
Use ALCRM servers to set permissions for separate document tasks, for example opening, editing, and printing. You
can also define document auditing policies on ALCRM servers.

Setting up digital signature validation
When you receive a signed document, you may want to validate its signature(s) to verify the signer and the signed
content. Depending on how you have configured your application, validation may occur automatically. Signature
validity is determined by checking the authenticity of the signature’s digital ID certificate status and document integrity:

• Authenticity verification confirms that the signer's certificate or its parent certificates exist in the validator’s list of
trusted identities. It also confirms whether the signing certificate is valid based on the user's Acrobat or Reader
configuration.
• Document integrity verification confirms whether the signed content changed after it was signed. If content
changes, document integrity verification confirms whether the content changed in a manner permitted by the
signer.

Set signature verification preferences
1 Open the Preferences dialog box.
2 Under Categories, select Signatures.
3 For Verification, click More.
4 To automatically validate all signatures in a PDF when you open the document, select Verify Signatures When The

Document Is Opened. This option is selected by default.

Verification Behavior
When Verifying These options specify methods that determine which plug-in to choose when verifying a signature.
The appropriate plug-in is often selected automatically. Contact your system administrator about specific plug-in
requirements for validating signatures.
Require Certificate Revocation Checking To Succeed Whenever Possible ... Checks certificates against a list of

excluded certificates during validation. This option is selected by default. If you deselect this option, the revocation
status for approval signatures is ignored. The revocation status is always checked for certifying signatures.
Verification Time
Verify Signatures Using Select an option to specify how to check the digital signature for validity. By default, you

can check the time based on when the signature was created. Alternatively, check based on the current time or the
time set by a timestamp server when the document was signed.
Use Expired Timestamps Uses the secure time provided by the timestamp or embedded in the signature, even if the
signature’s certificate has expired. This option is selected by default. Deselecting this option allows discarding of
expired timestamps.
Verification Information Specifies whether to add verification information to the signed PDF. Default is to alert user
when verification information is too large.
Windows Integration specify whether to trust all root certificates in the Windows Certificates feature when
validating signatures and certified documents. Selecting these options can compromise security.

Note: It is not recommended to trust all root certificates in the Windows Certificate feature. Many certificates that are
distributed with Windows are designed for purposes other than establishing trusted identities.

Set the trust level of a certificate
In Acrobat or Reader, the signature of a certified or signed document is valid if you and the signer have a trust
relationship. The trust level of the certificate indicates the actions for which you trust the signer.

the signer for certifying documents, and you accept actions that the certified document takes.
When this option is selected, the following options are available:
Dynamic content Allows movies, sound, and other dynamic elements to play in a certified document.
Embedded High Privilege JavaScript Allows privileged JavaScript embedded in PDF files to run. JavaScript files can

be used in malicious ways. It is prudent to select this option only when necessary on certificates you trust.
Privileged System Operations Allows Internet connections, cross domain scripting, silent printing, external-object
references, and import/export methodology operations on certified documents.

Note: Only allow Embedded High Privilege JavaScript and Privileged System Operations for sources you trust and work
with closely. For example, use these options for your employer or service provider.

Certify a PDF
When you certify a PDF, you indicate that you approve of its contents. You also specify the types of changes that are
permitted for the document to remain certified. For example, suppose that a government agency creates a form with
signature fields. When the form is complete, the agency certifies the document, allowing users to change only form
fields and sign the document. Users can fill the form and sign the document. However, if they remove pages or add
comments, the document doesn’t retain its certified status.
You can apply a certifying signature only if the PDF doesn’t already contain any other signatures. Certifying signatures
can be visible or invisible. A blue ribbon icon in the Signatures panel indicates a valid certifying signature. A digital
ID is required to add the certifying digital signature.
1 Remove content that may compromise document security, such as JavaScripts, actions, or embedded media.
2 Choose Tools &amp;gt; Certificates to open the panel.
3 Click one of the following options:

Places a certified signature in either an exiting digital signature field (if available) or in the

5 Save the PDF using a different filename than the original file, and then close the document without making

additional changes. It is a good idea to save it as a different file so that you can retain the original unsigned
document.

Timestamp a document
Acrobat provides users with the capability to add a document timestamp to a PDF without also requiring an identitybased signature. A timestamp server is required to timestamp a PDF. (See Configure a timestamp server.) A timestamp
assures the authenticity and existence of a document at a particular time. These timestamps are compliant with the
timestamp and revocation features described in Part 4 of ETSI 102 778 PDF Advanced Electronic Signatures (PAdES)
standard. Users of Reader X (and later) can also timestamp a document if the document includes appropriate Reader
Enabling features.
For more information on PAdES, see blogs.adobe.com/security/2009/09/eliminating_the_penone_step_at.html
1 Open the document to which you want to add a timestamp.
2 Choose Tools &amp;gt; Certificates &amp;gt; Time Stamp.

3 When you’re done, close the temporary document.

Trust a signer’s certificate
Trusting a certificate involves adding it to the user’s trusted identity list in the Trusted Identity Manager and manually
setting its trust level. End users often exchange certificates as needed when using certificate security. Alternatively, they
add certificates directly from signatures in signed documents and then set trust levels. However, enterprises often
require employees to validate the signatures of others without performing any manual task. Acrobat trusts all
certificates for signing and certifying that chain up to a trust anchor. Therefore, administrators should preconfigure
client installations or let their end users add a trust anchor or anchors. For more information on trusting certificates,
see About certificate-based signatures.

PDF Portfolios and digital signatures
You can sign component PDFs within a PDF Portfolio, or sign the PDF Portfolio as a whole. Signing a component PDF
locks the PDF for editing and secures its content. After signing all the component PDFs, you can sign the entire PDF
Portfolio to finalize it. Alternatively, you can sign the PDF Portfolio as a whole to lock the content of all component
PDFs simultaneously.

• To sign a component PDF, see Sign PDF documents. The signed PDF is automatically saved to the PDF Portfolio.
• To sign a PDF Portfolio as a whole, sign the cover sheet (View &amp;gt; Portfolio &amp;gt; Cover Sheet). Once you sign the PDF
Portfolio as a whole, you cannot add signatures to the component documents. However, you can add more
signatures to the cover sheet.

PDF in a separate window. Right-click the attachment, and choose Open File from the context menu. To view
signatures on the PDF Portfolio, navigate to the cover sheet to view the document message bar and signatures pane.

Signed and certified PDF Portfolios
A properly signed or certified PDF Portfolio has one or more signatures that approve or certify the PDF Portfolio. The
most significant signature appears in a Signature Badge in the toolbar. Details of all signatures appear in the cover sheet.

XML data signatures
Acrobat and Reader support XML data signatures that are used to sign data in XML Forms Architectures (XFA) forms.
The form author provides XML signing, validating, or clearing instructions for form events, such as button click, file
save, or submit.
XML data signatures conform to the W3C XML-Signature standard. Like PDF digital signatures, XML digital
signatures ensure integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation in documents.
However, PDF signatures have multiple data verification states. Some states are called when a user alters the PDFsigned content. In contrast, XML signatures only have two data verification states, valid and invalid. The invalid state
is called when a user alters the XML-signed content.

Establish long-term signature validation
Long-term signature validation allows you to check the validity of a signature long after the document was signed. To
achieve long-term validation, all the required elements for signature validation must be embedded in the signed PDF.
Embedding these elements can occur when the document is signed, or after signature creation.
Without certain information added to the PDF, a signature can be validated for only a limited time. This limitation
occurs because certificates related to the signature eventually expire or are revoked. Once a certificate expires, the
issuing authority is no longer responsible for providing revocation status on that certificate. Without conforming
revocation status, the signature cannot be validated.
The required elements for establishing the validity of a signature include the signing certificate chain, certificate
revocation status, and possibly a timestamp. If the required elements are available and embedded during signing, the
signature can be validated requiring external resources for validation. Acrobat and Reader can embed the required
elements, if the elements are available. The PDF creator must enable usage rights for Reader users (File &amp;gt; Save As Other
&amp;gt; Reader Extended PDF).
Note: Embedding timestamp information requires an appropriately configured timestamp server. In addition, the signature
validation time must be set to Secure Time (Preferences &amp;gt; Security &amp;gt;Advanced Preferences &amp;gt; Verification tab). CDS
certificates can add verification information, such as revocation and timestamp into the document without requiring any
configuration from the signer. However, the signer must be online to fetch the appropriate information.

Add verification information after signing
In some workflows, signature validation information is unavailable at signing, but can be obtained later. For example,
a company official may sign a contract using a laptop while traveling by air. The computer cannot communicate with
the Internet to obtain timestamping and revocation information to add to the signature. When Internet access is
available later, anyone who validates the signature can add this information to the PDF. All subsequent signature
validations can also use this information.
1 Ensure that your computer can connect to the appropriate network resources, and then right-click the signature in

the PDF.
2 Choose Add Verification Information.

Information and methods used to include this long term validation (LTV) information in the PDF comply with Part 4

Adobe Approved Trust List
Current Members
Check out our current AATL members.

What is it?
The Adobe Approved Trust List is a program that allows millions of users around the world to create digital signatures
that are trusted whenever the signed document is opened in Adobe® Acrobat® or Reader® software. Essentially, both
Acrobat and Reader have been programmed to reach out to a web page to periodically download a list of trusted "root"
digital certificates. Any digital signature created with a credential that can trace a relationship ("chain") back to the
high-assurance, trustworthy certificates on this list is trusted by Acrobat and Reader.

Last updated 5/10/2016

Electronic signatures

How does it work?
Certificate authorities (CAs) — entities that provide digital signing credentials to other organizations and users — as
well as governments and businesses that provide certificates to their citizens and employees can apply to Adobe to join
the AATL program by submitting application materials and their root certificates (or another qualifying certificate).
After verifying that the applicant's services and credentials meet the assurance levels imposed by the AATL technical
requirements, Adobe adds the certificate(s) to the Trust List itself, digitally signs the Trust List with an Adobe corporate
digital ID that is linked to the Adobe Root certificate embedded in Adobe products, and then posts the list to a website
hosted by Adobe.
Afterwards, when any user receives a digitally signed document from a signer whose digital certificate can trace its
lineage (chain) back to a certificate on the AATL, that signature will automatically be trusted.

Why is this feature important?
When you receive a digitally signed document, both Reader and Acrobat ask three key questions to validate the
signature:
1 Is the digital certificate that signed the document still valid? Has it expired or been revoked?
2 Has the document been changed since it was signed? Has the integrity of the document been affected? If there are

changes, are they allowed changes or not?
3 Finally, does this certificate chain up to a certificate listed in the Trusted Identity list? If so, the signature will be

trusted automatically.
The answers to the first two questions are handled by Acrobat and Reader based on an analysis of the information
contained within the certificate and the signed document itself. However, it's the answer to the third question that has
always posed a challenge to the electronic signatures marketplace. How do you know if you can trust a digital signature?
What aspects of the signer's digital certificate/credential should be noted? How important is verifying the signer's
identity, and how critical is the storage of the signing key itself?
Adobe understands that the relying party must be free to make its own trust decisions based on its unique
circumstances. However, Adobe has also been looking at ways to help relying parties make this determination and in
so doing make the process of using digital signatures that much easier. The Adobe Approved Trust List is simply the
latest in these efforts.

How does this program compare to the CDS program?
Back in 2005, Adobe unveiled the Certified Document Services (CDS) program, which automatically trusts new digital
IDs that are chained to (part of the family of) the Adobe Root certificate embedded in Adobe products. CDS, the
predecessor to the AATL, has five certificate authorities offering certificates. While the high-level benefits of the Adobe
Approved Trust List program are similar, existing certificate communities, such as government eID programs, can join
the Trust List, as the chain to the Adobe Root certificate is not required.

Why would my organization want to join?
If you represent an organization or government that already has a significant investment in digital certificates (that is,
hundreds of thousands of users), and these certificates are being used to sign PDF documents, then you already know
the importance of trust and how confusion over a digital signature can lead to support calls, questions, and general
uneasiness about using a digital signature. The AATL program provides an easy way for all your certificate holders,
assuming they meet the technical requirements, to sign documents confidently, knowing that recipients will not only
get the cost savings and a resulting "green" benefit from staying with an electronic document, but also the integritychecking and trusted green checkmark/blue ribbon experience when they open the document.

Manage trusted identities
A digital ID includes a certificate with a public key and a private key. Participants in signing and certificate security
workflows exchange the public part (the certificate) of their digital ID. Once you obtain someone’s certificate and add
it to your trusted identities list, you can encrypt documents for them. There may be instances when the certificate does
not already chain up to a trust anchor that you have specified. In such cases, you can set the certificate’s trust level so
that you can validate the owner’s signature. Understanding what a trusted identity is and how trust levels are set lets you
streamline workflows and troubleshoot problems. For example, you can add trusted identities in advance and
individually set the trust for each certificate. In enterprise settings, your trusted identities list may be preconfigured.
You may also be able to search a directory server for additional certificates.

Import and export a certificate
You can export your certificate and contact data for use in signature validation and certificate security workflows. Other
users can import that data to their trusted identity list. Contact data added in this manner helps expand the number of
users that can participate in secure document workflows. See the Digital Signature Guide (PDF) at
www.adobe.com/go/learn_acr_security_en for information on exporting certificates.

Setting certificate trust
You build a list of trusted identities by getting digital ID certificates from signing participants and certificate security
workflows. You get this information from a server, file, or a signed document. For signing workflows, you can get this
information during the signature validation process. For certificate security workflows involving encryption, request
the information in advance. This enables you to encrypt the document with the document recipient’s public key. See
the Digital Signature Guide (PDF) at www.adobe.com/go/learn_acr_security_en for more information on setting up
certificate trust.

Adobe Approved Trust List (AATL)
The Adobe Approved Trust List (AATL) allows users to create certificate-based signatures that are trusted whenever
the signed document is opened in Acrobat 9 or Reader 9 and later. Both Acrobat and Reader access an Adobe hosted
web page to download a list of trusted root digital certificates every 30 days. Any certificate-based signature created
with a credential that can trace a relationship back to a certificate on this list is trusted. The trusted root certificates have
been verified by Adobe and other authorities to meet specific technical requirements. They represent high assurance
identity and signing credentials. The certificates include government and citizen credentials from across the world. In
addition, they include credentials from global commercial certificate authorities and qualified certification service
providers (CSPs) in Europe.
For details about this feature and why it is important for validating a signature, see the AATL web page at
www.adobe.com/security/approved-trust-list.html.
AATL is enabled by default. The list downloads when you first open or create a signed document, or access the various
security preferences dialogs. You are asked to verify if the automatic update in the AATL is acceptable to you. Click Yes
if you want to receive the updates.
Note: Check with your administrator if your organization has turned off access to the AATL for some reason.
To verify the AATL is enabled:
1 Choose Edit &amp;gt; Preferences (Windows) or Acrobat DC/Acrobat Reader DC &amp;gt; Preferences.
2 From the Categories on the left, select Trust Manager.
3 Select the option Load Trusted Root Certificates From An Adobe Server.

This option allows Acrobat or Reader to automatically download trust settings from an Adobe server. These trust
settings ensure that the user or organization associated with the certificate has met the assurance levels of the Adobe
Approved Trust List program.
4 Do one of the following:

• To be prompted when new root certificates are available from Adobe, select Ask Before Updating.
• To download the latest version of the Trust List from Adobe, click Update Now.

Validating signatures

Validating certificate-based signatures
Set your verification preferences in advance. This helps ensure that certificate-based signatures are valid when you open
a PDF and verification details appear with the signature. See Set signature verification preferencesfor details.
When certificate-based signatures are validated, an icon appears in the document message bar to indicate the signature
status. Additional status details appear in the Signatures panel and in the Signature Properties dialog box.

<!-- 378c4e2b-47cb-4275-82df-a79e6c053702 <=< ACCEPT -->
Setting up validation for certificate-based signatures
When you receive a signed document, you may want to validate its signature(s) to verify the signer and the signed
content. Depending on how you have configured your application, validation may occur automatically. Signature
validity is determined by checking the authenticity of the signature’s digital ID certificate status and document integrity:

• Authenticity verification confirms that the signer's certificate or its parent certificates exist in the validator’s list of
trusted identities. It also confirms whether the signing certificate is valid based on the user's Acrobat or Reader
configuration.
• Document integrity verification confirms whether the signed content changed after it was signed. If content
changes, document integrity verification confirms whether the content changed in a manner permitted by the
signer.

Set signature verification preferences
1 Open the Preferences dialog box.
2 Under Categories, select Signatures.
3 For Verification, click More.
4 To automatically validate all signatures in a PDF when you open the document, select Verify Signatures When The

Document Is Opened. This option is selected by default.
5 Select verification options as needed and click OK.
Verification Behavior

These options specify methods that determine which plug-in to choose when verifying a signature. The appropriate
plug-in is often selected automatically. Contact your system administrator about specific plug-in requirements for
validating signatures.

Require Certificate Revocation Checking To Succeed Whenever Possible ...
Checks certificates against a list of excluded certificates during validation. This option is selected by default. If you
deselect this option, the revocation status for approval signatures is ignored. The revocation status is always checked
for certifying signatures.

Verification Time

Last updated 5/10/2016

Electronic signatures

Verify Signatures Using
Select an option to specify how to check the certificate-based signature for validity. By default, you can check the
time based on when the signature was created. Alternatively, check based on the current time or the time set by a
timestamp server when the document was signed.

Use Expired Timestamps
Uses the secure time provided by the timestamp or embedded in the signature, even if the signature’s certificate has
expired. This option is selected by default. Deselecting this option allows discarding of expired timestamps.

Verification Information Specifies whether to add verification information to the signed PDF. Default is to alert user
when verification information is too large.
Windows Integration specify whether to trust all root certificates in the Windows Certificates feature when
validating signatures and certified documents. Selecting these options can compromise security.

Note: It is not recommended to trust all root certificates in the Windows Certificate feature. Many certificates that are
distributed with Windows are designed for purposes other than establishing trusted identities.

Set the trust level of a certificate
In Acrobat or Reader, the signature of a certified or signed document is valid if you and the signer have a trust
relationship. The trust level of the certificate indicates the actions for which you trust the signer.
You can change the trust settings of certificates to allow specific actions. For example, you can change the settings to
enable the dynamic content and embedded JavaScript within the certified document.
1 Open the Preferences dialog box.
2 Under Categories, select Signatures.
3 For Identities &amp; Trusted Certificates, click More.
4 Select Trusted Certificates on the left.
5 Select a certificate from the list, and click Edit Trust.
6 In the Trust tab, select any of the following items to trust this certificate:
Use This Certificate As A Trusted Root A root certificate is the originating authority in a chain of certificate

authorities that issued the certificate. By trusting the root certificate, you trust all certificates issued by that
certificate authority.
Signed Documents Or Data Acknowledges the identity of the signer.
Certified Documents Trusts documents in which the author has certified the document with a signature. You trust
the signer for certifying documents, and you accept actions that the certified document takes.

When this option is selected, the following options are available:
Dynamic content
Allows movies, sound, and other dynamic elements to play in a certified document.

Embedded High Privilege JavaScript

Trust a signer’s certificate
Trusting a certificate involves adding it to the user’s trusted identity list in the Trusted Identity Manager and manually
setting its trust level. End users often exchange certificates as needed when using certificate security. Alternatively, they
add certificates directly from signatures in signed documents and then set trust levels. However, enterprises often
require employees to validate the signatures of others without performing any manual task. Acrobat trusts all
certificates for signing and certifying that chain up to a trust anchor. Therefore, administrators should preconfigure
client installations or let their end users add a trust anchor or anchors. For more information on trusting certificates,
see Certificate-based signatures.

PDF Portfolios and certificate-based signatures
You can sign component PDFs within a PDF Portfolio, or sign the PDF Portfolio as a whole. Signing a component PDF
locks the PDF for editing and secures its content. After signing all the component PDFs, you can sign the entire PDF
Portfolio to finalize it. Alternatively, you can sign the PDF Portfolio as a whole to lock the content of all component
PDFs simultaneously.

• To sign a component PDF, see Sign PDF documents. The signed PDF is automatically saved to the PDF Portfolio.
• To sign a PDF Portfolio as a whole, sign the cover sheet (View &amp;gt; Portfolio &amp;gt; Cover Sheet). Once you sign the PDF
Portfolio as a whole, you cannot add signatures to the component documents. However, you can add more
signatures to the cover sheet.

Certificate-based signatures on attachments to component PDFs
You can add signatures to attachments before signing the cover sheet. To apply signatures to attached PDFs, open the
PDF in a separate window. Right-click the attachment, and choose Open File from the context menu. To view
signatures on the PDF Portfolio, navigate to the cover sheet to view the document message bar and signatures pane.

Signed and certified PDF Portfolios
A properly signed or certified PDF Portfolio has one or more signatures that approve or certify the PDF Portfolio. The
most significant signature appears in a Signature Badge in the toolbar. Details of all signatures appear in the cover sheet.

• To view the name of the organization or person that signed the PDF Portfolio, hover the pointer over the Signature
Badge.
• To view details about the signature that appears in the Signature Badge, click the Signature Badge. The cover sheet
and the Signatures pane on the left open with details.
If the PDF Portfolio approval or certification is invalid or has a problem, the Signature Badge shows a warning icon. To
view an explanation of the problem, hover the pointer over a Signature Badge with a warning icon. Different warning
icons appear for different situations.
For a list and explanation of each warning, see the DigSig Admin Guide at www.adobe.com/go/learn_acr_security_en.

XML data signatures
Acrobat and Reader support XML data signatures that are used to sign data in XML Forms Architectures (XFA) forms.
The form author provides XML signing, validating, or clearing instructions for form events, such as button click, file
save, or submit.
XML data signatures conform to the W3C XML-Signature standard. Like PDF digital signatures, XML digital
signatures ensure integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation in documents.
However, PDF signatures have multiple data verification states. Some states are called when a user alters the PDFsigned content. In contrast, XML signatures only have two data verification states, valid and invalid. The invalid state
is called when a user alters the XML-signed content.

Establish long-term signature validation
Long-term signature validation allows you to check the validity of a signature long after the document was signed. To
achieve long-term validation, all the required elements for signature validation must be embedded in the signed PDF.
Embedding these elements can occur when the document is signed, or after signature creation.
Without certain information added to the PDF, a signature can be validated for only a limited time. This limitation
occurs because certificates related to the signature eventually expire or are revoked. Once a certificate expires, the
issuing authority is no longer responsible for providing revocation status on that certificate. Without conforming
revocation status, the signature cannot be validated.
The required elements for establishing the validity of a signature include the signing certificate chain, certificate
revocation status, and possibly a timestamp. If the required elements are available and embedded during signing, the
signature can be validated requiring external resources for validation. Acrobat and Reader can embed the required
elements, if the elements are available. The PDF creator must enable usage rights for Reader users (File &amp;gt; Save As Other
&amp;gt; Reader Extended PDF).
Note: Embedding timestamp information requires an appropriately configured timestamp server. In addition, the signature
validation time must be set to Secure Time (Preferences &amp;gt; Security &amp;gt;Advanced Preferences &amp;gt; Verification tab). CDS
certificates can add verification information, such as revocation and timestamp into the document without requiring any
configuration from the signer. However, the signer must be online to fetch the appropriate information.

Add verification information after signing
In some workflows, signature validation information is unavailable at signing, but can be obtained later. For example,
a company official may sign a contract using a laptop while traveling by air. The computer cannot communicate with
the Internet to obtain timestamping and revocation information to add to the signature. When Internet access is
available later, anyone who validates the signature can add this information to the PDF. All subsequent signature
validations can also use this information.
1 Ensure that your computer can connect to the appropriate network resources, and then right-click the signature in

the PDF.
2 Choose Add Verification Information.

Information and methods used to include this long term validation (LTV) information in the PDF comply with Part 4
of the ETSI 102 778 PDF Advanced Electronic Signatures (PAdES) standard. For more information, see
blogs.adobe.com/security/2009/09/eliminating_the_penone_step_at.html. The command is unavailable if the
signature is invalid, or is signed with a self-signed certificate. The command is also unavailable in case the verification
time equals the current time.

Basic PDF printing tasks
Print button missing?
If you can't see the Print and Cancel buttons, your monitor is set to a low screen resolution. Acrobat DC and Acrobat
Reader DC are not designed for low-resolution displays (the minimum recommended is 1024 x 768). However, you can
work around this limitation. Do any of the following to print your document:

• Press Enter or Return.
• If a scroll bar appears on the right of the dialog box, drag the slider down to access the buttons.
(Windows) On some monitors, the Windows taskbar covers the Print button. You can hide the taskbar so it appears
only when you mouse to the bottom of the screen. Right-click the taskbar and choose Properties. In the Properties dialog
box, select Auto-hide the Taskbar, then click OK.

Common printing tasks

Print on both sides of the paper

You can print double-sided if your printer supports double-sided (duplex printing) feature.
Note: Double-sided printing is also called duplex, back to back, front and back, or two-sided printing.
The printer driver controls the options, not Adobe Acrobat or Adobe Reader. Check your printer documentation to see
what features your printer supports.

• In the Print dialog box, enable Print on both sides of paper, and choose an edge to Flip.

Last updated 5/10/2016

Printing

Note: There could be a scenario when a printer actually supports duplex and this option does not appear on Print
dialog. In such cases, you may click on printer properties to directly access this option from printer preferences.

Print in black and white

You can print a color PDF in shades of gray (also known as grayscale or composite gray).

• In the Print dialog box, enable Print In Grayscale (Black And White).

Print at a different size

You can scale the page to shrink or enlarge pages when you print. You can automatically scale to fit the paper or
manually scale by percentages

• In the Print dialog box, click Size and then specify the scaling options.

Fit Reduces or enlarges each page to fit the printable area of the currently selected paper size. For PostScript® printers,
the PPD determines the printable area of the paper.

Last updated 5/10/2016

406
Printing

Actual Size Prints the pages without scaling. Pages or selections that don’t fit on the paper are cropped. You can set this
option as the default using the None print preset. See Create print presets.
Shrink Oversize Pages Shrinks large pages to fit the currently selected paper size but doesn’t enlarge small pages. If an
area is selected and is larger than the printable area of the currently selected paper, it’s scaled to fit the printable area.
This option is always active during N-up printing. You can set this option as the default using the Default print preset.
See Create print presets.
Custom Scale Resizes the page by the percentage you specify.
Choose Paper Source By PDF Page Size (Windows) Uses the PDF page size to determine the output tray rather than
the page setup option. This option is useful for printing PDFs that contain multiple page sizes on printers that have
different-sized output trays.

Print posters and banners

You can print a large format document, such as a poster or banner, by splitting the page across multiple sheets of paper
(called "tiling"). The Poster option calculates how many sheets of paper are needed. You can adjust the size of the
original to best fit the paper and specify how much each "tile" overlaps. You can then piece together the tiles.

• In the Print dialog box, click Poster and then specify the tiling options.

Tile Scale Scales the pages by the amount you specify.
OverlapDetermines the amount each tile overlaps adjacent tiles.
Cut MarksAdds guide marks to each page to help you trim the overlap.
LabelsAdds the filename and page number on each "tile."
Tile Only Large Pages Applies tiling to pages that are larger than the selected paper size at the specified scale. These
pages are mapped to multiple sheets of paper.

Print multiple pages on a sheet

Last updated 5/10/2016

407
Printing

You can print more than one page of a PDF onto a single sheet of paper. Printing multiple pages per sheet is also called
n-up printing (such as 2-up or 6-up). You can specify how the pages are ordered, either horizontally across the page or
in vertical columns.

Pages Per Sheet Prints a predefined number of pages, or a custom number (up to 99), horizontally and vertically. If you
select a predefined number from the menu, Acrobat automatically selects the best paper orientation.
Page Order Defines how the pages are ordered on paper. Horizontal places pages from left to right, top to bottom.
Horizontal Reversed places pages from right to left, top to bottom. Vertical places pages top to bottom, left to right.
Vertical Reversed places pages top to bottom, right to left. Both reversed options are suitable for Asian-language
documents.
Print Page Border Prints the crop box (the page boundary of PDF pages).
Note: Printing multiple pages per sheet in Acrobat is independent of the N-up printing features of printer drivers. The
Acrobat print settings don’t reflect the N-up settings of the printer drivers. Select the multple pages options either in
Acrobat or in the printer driver, but not both.

Print booklets

You can print a multipage document as a booklet. The pages are laid out two per sheet. When you collate, fold, and
staple the double-sided sheets, the result is a single book with the correct page order.

• In the Print dialog box, click Booklet and then specify the booklet options.

Printing

Current Page Prints the page that is visible in the current view.
Pages Specifies the range of pages to print. Use a hyphen to separate numbers in a range. Use a comma to separate
individual pages or ranges (for example, 6, 10-31, 42). How you specify the numbers depends on the Page Display
preference. If Use Logical Page Numbers is selected, you enter numbers that match the numbering on the pages. For
example, if the first page of a document is numbered iii, you enter iii to print that page.

To print from a specific page to the end of the document, enter the page with a hyphen. For example, “11-” prints page
11 to the last page of the document.
More Options Displays additional options to control which pages print.
Current View/Selected Graphic (Click More Options under Pages To Print.) Prints the area currently visible, the
selected pages, or the text and graphics copied with the Snapshot tool. The option name changes depending on if you
have selected pages or used the Snapshot tool.
Odd Or Even Pages Choose which pages to print: All Pages In Range, Odd Pages Only, or Even Pages Only. For

example, if you set the range to 2, 7–10 and choose Even Pages Only, only pages 2, 8, and 10 print.
Reverse Pages Prints pages in reverse order. If page ranges are entered, the pages print opposite of the order in which

they were entered. For example, if the Pages box shows 3–5, 7–10, selecting Reverse Pages prints pages 10–7, and then
5–3.

Orientation
Auto Portrait/Landscape Automatically selects the page orientation that best matches the content and paper. For

example, a spreadsheet could print horizontally, while a newsletter could print vertically. The Auto-Portait/Landscape
option overrides the orientation selected in Page Setup.
Additional resources
For more information on printing, see the forums on printing and prepress.

Print Layers
Normally, when you print a PDF that contains layers, just the content that is visible onscreen is printed. However, the
creator of a layered PDF can control what prints, regardless of its visibility onscreen. The PDF creator can require that
watermarks print or prevent the printing of confidential information. If the document is designed to print differently
from how it currently appears onscreen, a message may appear in the Print dialog box. The Preview image in the Print

unavailable in the Options menu.

Change print settings for a layer
1 Click the Layers icon

in the navigation panel. (If the Layers icon is not visible, choose View &amp;gt; Show/Hide &amp;gt;
Navigation Panes &amp;gt; Layers.)

2 Expand the Layers area, select a layer, and then select Layer Properties from the Options menu

.

3 In the Layer Properties dialog box, choose one of the following from the Print pop-up menu:
Always Prints Forces the layer to print.
Never Prints Forces the layer not to print.
Prints When Visible Matches printed output to onscreen visibility.

Note: In Reader, you can open the Layer Properties dialog box, but you cannot change the settings.

Create print presets
A PDF can contain a set of print presets, a group of document-specific values that is used to set basic print options. By
creating a print preset for a document, you can avoid manually setting certain options in the Print dialog box each time
you print the document. It’s best to define print settings for a PDF at the time that you create it. However, print presets
provide a means to add basic print settings to a PDF at any time.
1 Choose File &amp;gt; Properties, and click the Advanced tab.
2 In the Print Dialog Presets section, set options and click OK.

The next time you open the Print dialog box, the values will be set to the print preset values. These settings are also used
when you print individual PDFs in a PDF Portfolio.
Note: To retain a print preset for a PDF, save the PDF after creating the print preset.

Print Dialog Presets
Page Scaling Prepopulates the Page Scaling menu in the Print dialog box with the option you choose:
Default Uses the application default setting, which is Shrink To Printable Area.
None Prevents automatic scaling to fit the printable area. Use this setting to preserve the scale in engineering

documents or the point size required for legal reasons.
Note: The Page Scaling menu in the Print dialog box shows additional options, but you cannot prepopulate the dialog box
with any of those options. Choose one of those options when you print.
DuplexMode For best results, the selected printer should support duplex printing if you select a duplex option.
Simplex Prints on one side of the paper.
Duplex Flip Long Edge Prints on both sides of the paper; the paper flips along the long edge.
Duplex Flip Short Edge Prints on both sides of the paper; the paper flips along the short edge.
Paper Source By Page Size Selects the option by the same name in the Print dialog box. Uses the PDF page size to

determine the output tray rather than the page setup option. This option is useful for printing PDFs that contain
multiple page sizes on printers that have different-sized output trays.
Print Page Range Prepopulates the Pages box in the Print Range section of the Print dialog box with the page ranges
you enter here. This setting is useful in a workflow where documents include both instruction pages and legal pages.

For example, if pages 1–2 represent instructions for filling out a form, you can set up your print job to print only the
form.
Number Of Copies Prepopulates the Copies box in the Print dialog box. Choose a number from 2 to 5, or choose
Default to use the application default, which is one copy. This limitation prevents multiple unwanted copies from being
printed.

Why can’t I print my document?
Start with these troubleshooting tips
Printing problems can have various causes. To identify the issue, start with this helpful TechNote: Troubleshoot PDF
printing | Acrobat, Reader.
The PDF is password protected, and printing is not allowed
If you receive a password-protected PDF, enter the designated password to print the document. Some protected
documents have restrictions that prevent you from printing, editing, or copying content in the document. If a
document has restrictions on printing, contact the PDF author.
(Windows only) Protected Mode is interfering
The default Protected Mode greatly enhances the security of Reader. To determine if Protected Mode is interfering with
printing, temporarily disable it: Right-click the document, and choose Page Display Preferences. Then click General on
the left, and deselect Enable Protected Mode At Startup. Close Reader, restart it, and try to print the document again.
Note: To ensure maximum security, when you finish printing, reselect Enable Protected Mode At Startup.

What should I do if Acrobat Reader DC is asking to save a file when a document
is printed?
If Adobe Reader is prompting you to save a file when you click Print, then click Advanced in the Print dialog and
deselect the Print to File option.
Note:

• Make sure have selected a physical printer to print to and not Adobe PDFXPS/Send note or any other virtual printer.
• The Print to File option was available on the Print dialog itself until Acrobat 10.X versions.

What should I do to print comments available on the PDF document?
There are certain annotations (example: pop-up notes) which are available on the PDF document and the annotations
do not print by default unless you want them to be printed.
This has been intentionally designed so that such annotations do not hinder the view of the content available behind
them.
However, there may be cases when you do want them to be printed. To print the pop-up notes and other annotations:
1 Go to Edit &amp;gt; Preferences.
2 Click Commenting.
3 Enable the option "Print notes and pop-ups."

About booklets
Booklets are documents with multiple pages arranged on sheets of paper that, when folded, present the correct page
order. You can create 2-up saddle-stitched booklets, where two side-by-side-pages, printed on both sides, are folded
once and fastened along the fold. The first page prints on the same printed sheet as the last page. The second page prints
on the same sheet as the second-to-last page, and so on. Each page is automatically centered on the sheet, and large
pages are scaled (shrunk) to fit the printable area. When you collate, fold, and staple the double-sided pages, the result
is a single book with correct pagination.
To print booklets, your printer must support either automatic or manual duplex printing (printing on both sides of the
paper). Manual duplex printing requires two separate printing passes: one to print the front side, and another to print
the back side. To find out whether your printer supports duplex printing, check the printer manual or contact the
printer manufacturer.

Printing

Print a booklet
1 Choose File &amp;gt; Print and select the printer.
2 Specify which pages to print:

• To print pages from front to back, select All.
• To divide a large booklet into smaller groupings, select Pages and specify a page range for the first grouping. Print
each page range separately.
3 Click Booklet.
4 To print certain pages on a different paper or paper stock, specify those pages using the Sheets From/To option.

Click the Properties button and select the correct paper tray and any other options as necessary.
5 Choose additional page handling options. The Preview image changes as you specify options.
Booklet Subset Determines which sides of the paper print. Choose Both Sides to automatically print both sides of

the paper (your printer must support automatic duplex printing). Choose Front Side Only to print all pages that
appear on the front side of the paper. After these pages print, flip them, choose File &amp;gt; Print again, and choose Back
Side Only. Depending on the printer model, you might have to turn and reorder the pages to print the back sides.
To prevent others in a shared printing environment from printing on your pages before you print the back side,
consider printing the back side pages using a different paper tray.
Auto-Rotate Pages Within Each Sheet Automatically rotates each page for the best fit in the printable area.
Sheets From Specifies the first and last sheet to print. Acrobat determines which sheets must print to accommodate

the print job. For example, if you have a 16-page document, then sheets 1 through 4 print.
Binding Determines the orientation for the binding. Choose Left for text read left-to-right; choose Left (Tall) for

paper folded on the long side, where the printable area is long and narrow. Choose Right for text read right-to-left
or for Asian-style vertical reading; choose Right (Tall) for paper folded on the long side.

Print PDFs in a PDF Portfolio
A PDF Portfolio contains multiple documents wrapped in one PDF. You can print the component PDFs in a PDF
Portfolio individually or together. Documents print in alphabetical order, regardless of the order of files.
To rename a file or change the order of files within a PDF Portfolio, use the Details view. See Working with component
files in a PDF Portfolio.
1 Open the PDF Portfolio. To print only certain PDFs, select those PDFs.
2 Choose File &amp;gt; Print, and then choose one of the following:
All PDF Files Prints all the PDFs in the PDF Portfolio.
Selected PDF Files Prints the selected PDFs. This option is available only when multiple files are selected in the list
of component documents.

3 Choose applicable printing options, and click OK.

Note: You must use the native application to print any component file that is not a PDF. To open a component file in its
native application, right-click the file and choose Open File In Native Application. (The native application must be installed
for you to open the file.)

Print from the Bookmarks tab
You can print the pages associated with bookmarks directly from the Bookmarks tab. Bookmarks appear in a hierarchy,
with parent bookmarks and child (dependent) bookmarks. If you print a parent bookmark, all page content associated
with child-level bookmarks also prints.
Not all bookmarks display page content, and therefore cannot be printed. For example, some bookmarks open a file or
play a sound. If you select a mix of printable and nonprintable bookmarks, the nonprintable bookmarks are ignored.
Note: Bookmarks made from tagged content always display page content because the tagged content represents printable
elements in the document structure, such as headings and figures.
1 Open a PDF with bookmarks. If necessary, choose View &amp;gt; Show/Hide &amp;gt; Navigation Panes &amp;gt; Bookmarks so the

bookmarks appear in the navigation pane.
2 Select one or more bookmarks, and then right-click the selection.
3 Choose Print Page(s) from the menu.

Advanced PDF print settings
More Help topics
Basic PDF printing tasks

About advanced print settings
If normal print settings don’t produce the results you expect, you may need to specify options in the Advanced Print
Setup dialog box. For example, if your printed output doesn’t match the document’s onscreen appearance, you may
need to try printing the document as an image (PostScript printers only). Or, if a PDF uses fonts that aren’t embedded,
you must download the fonts to the printer when you print the document.
Other advanced printing options in Acrobat Pro DC let you add printer marks to your printed output and choose how
to handle color.

Set advanced print options (Acrobat Standard)
The Advanced Print Setup dialog box is available for PostScript and non-PostScript printers.
1 In the Print dialog box, click Advanced.

To learn more about an option, select it. A description appears at the bottom of the dialog box.
2 Set options, and then click OK.

Note: Acrobat sets the PostScript level automatically, based on the selected printer.

Set advanced print options (Acrobat Pro DC)
Print settings are preserved until you change them. When you change an option, the Settings value automatically
updates from Acrobat Default to Custom, and the new settings are preserved. You can also save custom settings using
a unique name.
1 In the Print dialog box, click Advanced.
2 If a custom printer settings file exists with the settings you want, choose it from the Settings menu. Otherwise,

choose Acrobat Default.
To learn more about an option, select it. A description of it appears at the bottom of the dialog box.
3 If normal printing doesn’t produce the desired results, select Print As Image and choose a resolution from the drop-

down list.
4 Select any of the panels on the left side of the Advanced Print Setup dialog box, and set options for either composite

or separations output.
Note: Some options in the general Print dialog box affect settings in the Advanced Print Setup dialog box. For example,
selecting the Print Color As Black option (Windows) affects color settings in Advanced Print Setup.

• Set color and other output conditions. See Output options (Acrobat Pro DC).
• Set options for printer marks. See Include marks and bleeds (Acrobat Pro DC).

Printing

• Set options for PostScript printers. See PostScript options.
Note: Acrobat sets the PostScript level automatically, based on the selected printer.

• Set options for managing color. See Color management options (Acrobat Pro DC)
5 To save the settings using a unique name, click Save As, specify a filename, and click OK.
6 Click OK to accept the settings and return to the Print dialog box.

PostScript options
Use the PostScript Options panel of the Advanced Print Setup dialog box to set options for a particular PostScript
printer. These options include how to handle nonresident printer fonts and whether to download Asian fonts. If a PDF
contains device-dependent settings, such as halftones and transfer functions, these settings can be sent in the PostScript
output to override the default settings in the printer. To use these options, you must be connected to a PostScript printer
or have a PostScript printer driver installed with a PPD file selected.
Font And Resource Policy Specifies how fonts and resources in the document are sent to a printer when those fonts and

resources aren’t present on the printer.
Send At Start Downloads all fonts and resources at the start of the print job. The fonts and resources remain on the

printer until the job has finished printing. This option is the fastest but uses the most printer memory.
Send By Range Downloads fonts and resources before printing the first page that uses them, and then discards them

when they are no longer needed. This option uses less printer memory. However, if a PostScript processor reorders the
pages later in the workflow, the font downloading can be incorrect, resulting in missing fonts. This option does not
work with some printers.
Send For Each Page Downloads all fonts and resources for a given page before the page prints, and then discards the

fonts when the page has finished printing. This option uses the least printer memory.
Print Method (Acrobat Pro DC) Specifies the level of PostScript to generate for the pages. Choose the level of PostScript

appropriate for your printer.
Language (Acrobat Pro DC) Specifies the level of PostScript to generate for the pages. Choose the level of PostScript
appropriate for your printer.
Download Asian Fonts Prints documents with Asian fonts that aren’t installed on the printer or embedded in the PDF.

The Asian fonts must be present on the system.
Emit Undercolor Removal/Black Generation (Acrobat Pro DC) Black Generation calculates the amount of black to be
used when reproducing a particular color. Undercolor removal (UCR) reduces cyan, magenta, and yellow components
to compensate for the black added by the black generation. Because it uses less ink, UCR is used for newsprint and
uncoated stock.
Emit Halftones (Acrobat Pro DC) Allows you to emit the embedded halftones instead of using the halftones in the
output device. Halftone information controls how much ink is deposited at a specific location on the paper. Varying the
dot size and density creates the illusion of variations of gray or continuous color. For a CMYK image, four halftone
screens are used: one for each ink used in the printing process.
Emit Transfer Functions (Acrobat Pro DC) Emits embedded transfer functions. Transfer functions are traditionally used

to compensate for dot gain or dot loss that occurs when an image is transferred to film. Dot gain occurs when the ink
dots that make up a printed image are larger (for example, due to spreading on paper) than in the halftone screen. Dot
loss occurs when the dots print smaller. With this option, the transfer functions are applied to the file when the file is
output.

Printing

Emit Flatness (Acrobat Pro DC) allows you to use the flatness value of the PDF if the PDF already has flatness settings.
If the PDF doesn’t have any flatness settings, Acrobat controls it for the PostScript printing. The flatness value sets the
limit for how much Acrobat can approximate a curve.
Emit PS Form Objects (Acrobat Pro DC) Emits PostScript form objects for Form XObjects within the PDF. Selecting this
option reduces the overall size of the print job, but it could increase the printer memory that is used. A form XObject
is a container of graphics objects (including path objects, text objects, and sampled images) within the PDF. Form
XObjects create a single description for complex objects that can appear many times in a single document, such as
background images or company logos.
Discolored Background Correction Prevents printing problems like red boxes over graphics, or pages printing
mirrored or upside down. These problems can occur when Acrobat or Reader cannot use the default Color Rendering
Dictionaries (CRDs) on some PostScript printers.
Always Use Host Collation (Acrobat Pro DC) Specifies if you want Acrobat to always use host collation for printing

without checking the printer driver. Acrobat uses printer collation by default. Printer collation sends the print jobs
separately to the printer and allows the printer to figure out how to collate the pages. For example if you send out two
copies of a two page job, the printer receives two jobs of two pages. Host collation figures out how to collate the pages
in Acrobat and then sends that job to the printer. For example if you send out two copies of a two page job, the printer
receives a single rearranged job of four pages.
Print As Image Prints pages as bitmap images. Select this option if normal printing doesn’t produce the desired results,

and specify a resolution. This option is available only for PostScript printers.

Downloading Asian fonts to a printer
Select the Download Asian Fonts option in the Advanced Print Setup dialog box if you want to print a PDF with Asian
fonts that aren’t installed on the printer or embedded in the document. Embedded fonts are downloaded whether or
not this option is selected. You can use this option with a PostScript Level 2 or higher printer. To make Asian fonts
available for downloading to a printer, be sure you have downloaded the fonts to your computer using the Custom or
Complete installation option during installation of Acrobat.
If Download Asian Fonts is not selected, the PDF prints correctly only if the referenced fonts are installed on the printer.
If the printer has similar fonts, the printer substitutes those. If there are no suitable fonts on the printer, Courier is used
for the text.
If Download Asian Fonts does not produce the results you want, print the PDF as a bitmap image. Printing a document
as an image may take longer than using a substituted printer font.
Note: Some fonts cannot be downloaded to a printer, either because the font is a bitmap or because font embedding is
restricted in that document. In these cases, a substitute font is used for printing, and the printed output may not match the
screen display.

Output options (Acrobat Pro DC)
Use the Output panel of the Advanced Print Setup dialog box to set output options.
Color Presents composite and separations options. Other options become available in the Output panel depending on

your selection in this menu. For more information about color composite and separations, see Printing color PDFs
(Acrobat Pro DC).
Flip Specifies if the orientation of the page on the media. Flip horizontal for wrong-reading documents, flip vertical to

change vertical orientation. This option is only enabled for separations and disabled for composites.
Negative Select this option to print the document reversed. For example, black appears as white on the resulting
output. This option is only enabled for separations and disabled for composites.

Screening Specifies the lines per inch (lpi) and dots per inch (dpi) combinations.
Trapping Specifies if trapping is off. Click Trap Presets to manage trapping presets.
Transparency Flattener Preset Flattens transparent objects according to the preset you choose.
Simulate Overprinting Simulates the effects of overprinting spot inks in composite output and converts spot colors to

process colors for printing; the document itself is unchanged. This option is useful for printing devices that don’t
support overprinting and is available only if you choose Composite from the Color menu. If you intend to use a file for
separations on a RIP (raster image processor) or for final output, don’t select this option.
Note: When printing to a printer that supports overprinting, make sure that this option is unselected, so the native
overprinting capabilities of the printer are used.
Use Maximum Available JPEG2000 Image Resolution Controls how resolution progression information, if present, is
used when generating PostScript. When selected, the maximum resolution data contained in the image is used. When
unselected, the resolution data is consistent with the resolution settings on the Transparency Flattening panel.
Ink Manager Modifies the way inks are treated while the current PDF is open. See Ink Manager overview.

Specify halftone screen frequency (Acrobat Pro DC)
In commercial printing, continuous tone is simulated by dots (called halftone dots) printed in rows (called lines or line
screens). Lines are printed at different angles to make the rows less noticeable. The Screening menu in the Output
section of the Print dialog box displays the recommended sets of line screens in lines per inch (lpi), and resolution in
dots per inch (dpi), based on the currently selected PPD. As you select inks in the ink list, the values in the Frequency
and Angle boxes change, showing you the halftone screen frequency and angle for that ink.
A high line-screen ruling (for example, 150 lpi) spaces the dots closely together to create a finely rendered image on the
press; a low line-screen ruling (60 lpi to 85 lpi) spaces the dots farther apart to create a coarser image. The size of the
dots is also determined by the line screen. A high line-screen ruling uses small dots; a low line-screen ruling uses large
dots. The most important factor in choosing a line-screen ruling is the type of printing press your job will use. Ask your
service provider how fine a line screen its press can hold, and make your choices accordingly.

A 65 lpi: Coarse screen for printing newsletters and grocery coupons B 85 lpi: Average screen for printing newspapers C 133 lpi: High-quality
screen for printing four-color magazines D 177 lpi: Very fine screen for printing annual reports and images in art books

Last updated 5/10/2016

Printing

The PPD files for high-resolution imagesetters offer a wide range of possible screen frequencies, paired with various
imagesetter resolutions. The PPD files for low-resolution printers typically have only a few choices for line screens,
usually coarser screens of between 53 lpi and 85 lpi. The coarser screens, however, give optimum results on
low-resolution printers. Using a finer screen of 100 lpi, for example, actually decreases the quality of your image when
you use a low-resolution printer for final output.
Follow these steps to specify halftone screen frequency:
In the Output panel of the Advanced Print Setup dialog box, do one of the following:

• To select one of the preset screen frequencies and printer resolution combinations, choose an option from the
Screening menu.
• To specify a custom halftone screen frequency, in the ink list, select the plate to be customized, and then enter
the lpi value in the Frequency box and a screen angle value in the Angle box.
Note: Before creating your own halftone screens, check with your print service provider for the preferred frequencies and
angles. Also, be aware that some output devices override the default frequencies and angles.

Specify the emulsion and image exposure (Acrobat Pro DC)
Depending on the type of printing press used and how information is transferred from the film to the printing plates,
you may need to give your service provider film negatives or positives, with emulsion side up or down. Emulsion refers
to the photosensitive layer on a piece of film or paper. Typically, print service providers require negative film in the
United States and positive film in Europe and Japan. Check with your service provider to determine which emulsion
direction they prefer.
To tell whether you are looking at the emulsion side or the nonemulsion side (also referred to as the base), examine the
final film under a good light. One side appears shinier than the other. The dull side is the emulsion side; the shiny side
is the base.

A Positive image B Negative C Negative with emulsion side down

Note: The emulsion and image exposure settings in the Print dialog box override any conflicting settings in the printer
driver. Always specify print settings using the Print dialog box.
Follow these steps to specify the emulsion and exposure:
1 Select Output on the left side of the Advanced Print Setup dialog box.
2 For Color, choose Separations.
3 For Flip, select one of the following options:
None Makes no changes to the orientation of the imageable area. Type that is in the image is readable (that is, “right

reading”) when the photosensitive layer is facing you. This is the default.
Horizontal Mirrors the imageable area across a vertical axis so that it is “wrong reading.”
Vertical Mirrors the imageable area across a horizontal axis so that it is upside down.

Last updated 5/10/2016

421
Printing

Horizontal And Vertical Mirrors the imageable area across the horizontal and vertical axes so that it is wrong
reading. Type is readable when the photosensitive layer is facing away from you. Images printed on film are often
printed Horizontal And Vertical.

4 Select the Negative option for negative film; deselect it for positive film.

Note: The Negative option is also available if you choose In-RIP Separations from the Color menu.

Include marks and bleeds (Acrobat Pro DC)
You can place printer marks on the page to indicate the boundaries of document boxes supported by Adobe PDF, such
as trim boxes and bleed boxes. These marks are not added as page content; however, they are included in the PostScript
output.
The options in the Marks And Bleeds panel are unavailable under these circumstances:

• The PDF includes printer marks added using a different Acrobat feature, the Add Printer Marks tool.
• The crop, bleed, and trim boxes are all the same size. The crop box is defined in the Crop Box dialog box (choose
Tools &amp;gt; Print Production &amp;gt; Set Page Boxes). If the artwork contains a bleed, make sure that the crop box is big
enough to accommodate the bleed box and other printer marks.

A Trim marks B Registration marks C Page information D Color bars E Bleed marks

1 Select Marks And Bleeds on the left side of the Advanced Print Setup dialog box.
2 Choose the printer marks you want. The marks appear in the preview on the left side of the Advanced Print Setup

Marks And Bleeds options
All Marks Creates all printer marks at once.
Style Determines the appearance of the marks. You can choose default InDesign marks, or marks from other

applications as listed.
Line Weight Determines the weight of the lines for trim, bleed, and registration marks.
Trim Marks Places a mark at each corner of the trim area to indicate the PDF trim box boundaries.
Bleed Marks Places a mark at each corner of the bleed box to indicate the PDF bleed box boundaries. A bleed box

defines the amount of extra area to image outside the defined page size.
Registration Marks Places marks outside the crop area for aligning the different separations in a color document.

Color Bars Adds a small square of color for each grayscale or process color. Spot colors converted to process colors are
represented using process colors. Your service provider uses these marks to adjust ink density on the printing press.
Page Information Places page information outside the crop area of the page. Page information includes the filename,

page number, current date and time, and color separation name.

Color management options (Acrobat Pro DC)
Use the Color Management panel of the Advanced Print Setup dialog box to set options for printing color. For more
information about printing color, see Printing color PDFs (Acrobat Pro DC).
Color Handling Determines if color management is used and whether it happens in the application or at the printing

device.
Acrobat color management Enables you to select an ICC Profile that describes the target output device.
Printer Color Management Sends the document’s color data along with the document profile directly to the printer and

lets the printer convert the document to the printer color space. The exact results of the color conversion can vary
among printers.
Same as Source (No Color Management) Discards all color management information and sends device color to the

printer.
Color Profile Determines the profile used for handling colors during printing.
Output Color Displays the output color based on the settings in the Output panel of the Advanced Print Setup dialog

box.
Treat grays as K-only grays Select this option to ensure that any grayscale as well as RGB graphical objects for which R,
G, B have equal values, are printed using only the black (K) when you enable color management and specify a CMYK
profile printing to a PostScript printer
Preserve Black Specifies that pure K-based CMYK colors are preserved as K-based in CMYK to CMYK conversions
that may occur when you enable color management and specify a CMYK profile printing to a PostScript printer.
Preserve CMYK Primaries Specifies that pure primary-based (C only, M only, Y only, or K only) CMYK colors are

preserved in CMYK to CMYK conversions that may occur when you enable color management and specify a CMYK
profile printing to a PostScript printer.
Apply Output Preview Settings Simulates the print space defined by the device identified in the Simulation Profile

menu of the Output Preview dialog box. (Choose Tools &amp;gt;Print Production &amp;gt; Output Preview.) This option allows you

Preview how colors overprint (Acrobat Pro DC)
Overprint preview provides an onscreen simulation that approximates blending and overprinting in the colorseparated output. Overprinting effects can also be simulated when you output to a composite printing device. Both of
these methods are useful for proofing color-separated documents.

Managing color (Acrobat Pro DC)
When you print a color-managed RGB or CMYK document, you can specify additional color management options to
keep color consistent in the output. For example, suppose the document contains a profile tailored for prepress output,
but you want to proof the colors on a desktop printer. In the Color Management panel of the Advanced Print settings
dialog box, you can temporarily convert the document’s colors to the color space of the desktop printer—the printer
profile is used instead of the current document profile when printing. In addition, you can send color data as RGB
values to printers using various RGB profiles.

About composite printing (Acrobat Pro DC)
When you print a color PDF, all of the colors used in the file print on one plate. This process is called composite printing.
The options available in the Output panel of the Advanced Print Setup dialog box depend on the selected printer.
Artwork that will be commercially reproduced and that contains more than a single color must be printed on separate
master plates, one for each color. This process is called color separation. If you’re creating color separations, you can
print a color or grayscale composite proof to check your work.
Consider the following issues when printing composites:

• Any overprinting options that you select print correctly only on a printer that supports overprinting. Since most
desktop printers don’t support overprinting, you can simulate the effects of overprinting by selecting Simulate
Overprinting in the Output panel of the Advanced Print Setup dialog box. Be aware that selecting Simulate
Overprinting converts spot colors to process colors for printing. If you intend to use a file for final output, do not
select this option.
• When you print to a black-and-white printer, a grayscale composite version of the pages is produced (unless you
select Print Color As Black in the main Print dialog box; this option prints all nonwhite color as black). If the
document contains color, visually correct grays are used to simulate that color. For example, the gray that simulates
a 20% tint of yellow is lighter than a 20% tint of black, since yellow is visually lighter than black.
Note: Remember that, like monitors, color printers vary greatly in color reproduction quality; thus, proofs from your service
provider are the best way to verify how the finished piece will look.

About separations (Acrobat Pro DC)
To produce high-quality separations, it helps to be familiar with the basics of printing, including line screens,
resolution, process colors, and spot colors.
If you are using a print service provider to produce separations, you’ll want to work closely with its experts before
beginning each job and during the process.
To reproduce color and continuous-tone images, printers usually separate artwork into four plates—one plate for each
of the cyan (C), yellow (Y), magenta (M), and black (K) portions of the image. When inked with the appropriate color
and printed in register with one another, these colors combine to reproduce the original artwork. The process of
dividing the image into two or more colors is called color separating, and the films from which the plates are created
are called the separations.

Print color separations (Acrobat Pro DC)
Acrobat supports host-based separations and in-RIP separations. The main difference between them is where the
separations are created—at the host computer (the system using Acrobat and the printer driver) or at the output device’s
RIP.
For host-based separations, Acrobat creates PostScript information for each of the separations required for the
document and sends that information to the output device. For in-RIP separations, the work of separating a file is
performed by the RIP. This method often takes less time than creating host-based separations, but it requires a
PostScript 3 output device with in-RIP separation capability. To produce in-RIP separations, you need a PPD file that
supports in-RIP separations, and any PostScript 3 output device or a PostScript Level 2 device whose RIP supports inRIP separations.

Prepare to print separations
Before you print separations, do the following:

• Calibrate your monitor. See Calibrate and profile your monitor.

Printing

• Specify whether the document contains trapping information, if known. See Declare the presence of trapping
information (Acrobat Pro DC).
• Preview separations and transparency flattening results. See Preview color separationsand Preview which areas of
artwork will be flattened.
• Run preflight inspections using desired criteria. See Preflight profiles (Acrobat Pro DC).
Note: If you use a print service provider to produce separations, you’ll want to work closely with its experts before beginning
each job and throughout the process.

Print separations
1 Choose File &amp;gt; Print, and choose a printer.
2 Choose an option from the Comments and Forms menu.
3 Choose print range and page handling options.
4 Click Advanced.
5 If you created a custom printer settings file with the appropriate separation settings, choose it from the Settings

menu at the top of the Advanced Print Setup dialog box.
6 Select Output on the left, and choose an option from the Color menu:

• Choose Separations if the PPD doesn’t support in-RIP separations.
• Choose In-RIP Separations if the PPD supports in-RIP separations. Trapping options appear. From the Trapping
menu, choose Adobe In-RIP or Off. If you choose Adobe In-RIP, click Trap Presets and select a preset. Click OK.
7 Specify settings for halftone screen frequency and the angle at which the selected ink’s halftone screen is rotated.
8 If the document contains objects with transparency settings, select an option from the Transparency Flattening

Preset menu.
9 Under Ink Manager, deselect any color you don’t want to separate.

The four process colors (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black) always appear at the top of the color plate list, followed
by spot colors in alphabetical order.
10 Click the Ink Manager button to modify ink settings for color separations.
11 Click Marks And Bleeds on the left, and select All Marks.
12 Click PostScript Options on the left, and select settings as needed. Click OK to close the dialog box, and then click

Printing

Declare the presence of trapping information (Acrobat Pro DC)
If you are sending your PDF files to a print service provider, you can use the Document Properties dialog box to specify
whether a PDF contains trapping information. This detail can help prevent the service provider from adding potentially
conflicting trapping commands to the file. Trapping information can either be imported with other PostScript
information from the authoring application, or it can be created in Acrobat using trapping presets supported by Adobe
In-RIP Trapping.
1 Open the PDF file, and choose File &amp;gt; Properties.
2 Click the Advanced tab.
3 Choose an option from the Trapped menu, and click OK.
Yes The file contains trapping information.
No The file doesn’t contain trapping information.
Unknown You don’t know whether the file contains trapping information.

Saving separations as PostScript (Acrobat Pro DC)
Depending on the prepress software available, a service provider may be able to perform such prepress activities as
trapping, imposition, separating, and OPI replacement at the output device’s RIP. Therefore, your service provider may
prefer to receive a composite PostScript file of the document optimized for in-RIP separations rather than a
preseparated PostScript file.
Saving the file as PostScript preserves the separation settings, the PPD information, and any color conversions you have
specified in the Advanced Print Setup dialog box.
For best results when generating PostScript for reuse in a print production workflow, use the Save As command rather
than the Print To File option available in the Print dialog box.

Printing

Print an oversized document
You can print a large format document, such as a poster or banner, by splitting the page across multiple sheets of paper
(called “tiling”). The tiling option calculates how many sheets of paper are needed. You can adjust the size of the original
to best fit the paper and specify how much each “tile” overlaps. You can then piece together the tiles.?
You can also scale up a standard-sized document and print it on multiple pages.
1 Choose File &amp;gt; Print.
2 Click Poster.
3 (Optional) Set any of these options, referring to the Preview image to check the output results:
Tile Scale Adjusts the scaling. The scaling affects how the sections of the PDF page map to the physical sheet of

paper. (Click in the Overlap field to force the preview to redraw with the new scale value.)
Overlap Specifies the minimum amount of duplicated information you want printed on each tile for ease in

assembly. The Overlap option uses the unit of measure specified for the document. The value should be greater than
the minimum nonprinting margins for the printer. You can specify up to half the size of the shortest side of the
document page to overlap. For example, tiles for a page that measures 11-by-17 inches (279.4mm-by-431.8mm) can
overlap up to 5.5 inches (139.7mm).
Labels Includes the PDF name, date of printing, and tile coordinate on every sheet. For example, Page 1 (1,1) means

row 1, column 1 of the first page. Tile coordinates are used for reassembling the tiles.
Cut Marks Prints marks on each corner of a tiled page for ease of assembly. Use this option in conjunction with the

Overlap option. When you specify an overlapping edge and then superimpose those edges, you can use the cut
marks to line up the tiles.
Tile Only Large Pages Tiles only oversized pages and prints standard pages as is.

Scale a document for printing
Acrobat can automatically scale a PDF to fit the paper, or you can resize pages by setting a specifc percentage.
1 Choose File &amp;gt; Print.
2 Click Size, and choose one of the following options:
Fit Scales small pages up and large pages down to fit the paper.
Shrink Oversize Pages Resizes only large pages to fit the paper, and prints small pages as they are.
Custom scale Resizes pages by the percentage you specify.

Note: If you don’t see a Page Scaling options, click the arrow next to the Printer menu to expose more controls in the

Chapter 12: Accessibility, tags, and reflow

Create and verify PDF accessibility (Acrobat Pro DC)

Acrobat DC tools make it easy to create accessible PDFs and check the accessibility of existing PDFs. You can create
PDFs to meet common accessibility standards, such as Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 and
PDF/UA (Universal Access, or ISO 14289). The simple, guided workflow lets you do the following:
Make PDFs accessible: A predefined action automates many tasks, checks accessibility, and provides instructions for
items that require manual fixes. Quickly find and fix problem areas.
Check accessibility: The Full Check tool verifies whether the document conforms to accessibility standards, such as
PDF/UA and WCAG 2.0.
Report accessibility status: The Accessibility Report summarizes the findings of the accessibility check. It contains
links to tools and documentation that assist in fixing problems.

Make PDFs accessible (Acrobat Pro DC)
The Make Accessible action walks you through the steps required to make a PDF accessible. It prompts to address
accessibility issues, such as a missing document description or title. It looks for common elements that need further
action, such as scanned text, form fields, tables, and images. You can run this action on all PDFs except dynamic forms
(XFA documents) or portfolios.
1 Choose Tools &amp;gt; Action Wizard.

The Action Wizard toolset is displayed in the secondary toolbar.
Note: A list of available actions is displayed under the Action List in the right-hand pane.
2 From the Action List, click Make Accessible.

The right-hand pane changes to display each task included in the Make Accessible action, as well as the instructions
to execute the action.
3 Select the files that you want to apply the Make Accessible action to. By default, the action runs on the document

that's currently open. Select Add Files to select additional files or a folder to run the action on.

4 Click Start.
5 Follow the prompts to complete the Make Accessible action.

Check accessibility of PDFs (Acrobat Pro DC)
A good way to check the accessibility of a document is to use tools that your readers will use. Even if you do not have
access to those tools, Adobe Acrobat DC provides an automated way to check the accessibility of a PDF file. The Full
Check feature in Acrobat DC checks a PDF for many of the characteristics of accessible PDFs. You can choose which
accessibility problems to look for and how you want the results reported.
1 Choose Tools &amp;gt; Accessibility.

The Accessibility toolset is displayed in the secondary toolbar.
2 In the secondary toolbar, click Full Check.

The Accessibility Checker Options dialog box is displayed.
3 In the Report Options section, select options for how you want to view the results. You can save the results as an

HTML file on your system, or attach the results file to the document itself.
4 Select a page range if you prefer to check individual pages of a document.

When you have a large document, running a full check one page at a time can be more efficient.
5 Select one or more of the Checking Options.

6 Click Start Checking. The results are displayed in the Accessibility Checker panel on the left, which also has helpful

links and hints for repairing issues. If you created a report in step 2, the results are available in the selected folder.
Because the Full Check feature cannot distinguish between essential and nonessential content types, some issues it
reports don’t affect readability. It’s a good idea to review all issues to determine which ones require correction.
The report displays one of the following statuses for each rule check:

• Passed: The item is accessible.
• Skipped By User: Rule was not checked because it wasn't selected in the Accessibility Checker Options dialog
box.
• Needs Manual Check: The Full Check feature couldn't check the item automatically. Verify the item manually.

Last updated 5/10/2016

Accessibility, tags, and reflow

• Failed: The item didn't pass the accessibility check.

In addition to Full Check, Acrobat DC provides other methods to check PDF accessibility:

•Use Reflow a PDFto quickly check the reading order.
• Use Read Out Loud to experience the document as readers who use the text-to-speech conversion tool experience it.
• Save the document as accessible text and then read the saved text file in a word-processing application. This exercise
enables you to emulate the end-user experience of readers who use a braille printer to read the document.
• Use the Touch Up Reading Order tool for PDFs (Acrobat Pro DC), Order, Tags, and Content panels to examine the
structure, reading order, and contents of a PDF.

Accessibility issues

Document

Prevent security settings from interfering with screen readers
A document author can specify that no part of an accessible PDF is to be copied, printed, extracted, commented on, or
edited. This setting could interfere with a screen reader's ability to read the document, because screen readers must be
able to copy or extract the document's text to convert it to speech.
This flag reports whether it's necessary to turn on the security settings that allow accessibility.
To fix the rule automatically, select Accessibility Permission Flag on the Accessibility Checker panel. Then, choose Fix
from the Options
menu.
Or, fix accessibility permissions manually:
1 Choose File &amp;gt; Properties &amp;gt; Security.
2 Choose No Security from the Security Method drop-down list.
3 Click OK and close the Document Properties dialog box.

If your assistive technology product is registered with Adobe as a Trusted Agent, you can read PDFs that might be
inaccessible to another assistive technology product. Acrobat recognizes when a screen reader or other product is a
Trusted Agent and overrides security settings that would typically limit access to the content for accessibility purposes.
However, the security settings remain in effect for all other purposes, such as to prevent printing, copying, extracting,
commenting, or editing text.

Other elements alternate text
This report checks for content, other than figures, that requires alternate text (such as multimedia, annotation, or 3D
model). Make sure that alternate text is always an alternate representation for content on the page. If an element has
alternate text but does not contain any page content, there is no way to determine which page it is on. If the Screen
Reader Options in the Reading preferences is not set to read the entire document, then screen readers don't read the
alternate text.

3 Remove the alternate text from the Object Properties dialog box, and then click OK.

Note: See the related WCAG section: 1.1.1 Non-text Content. (A)

Tables
Because table structure can be complex, it is best practice to check them for accessibility manually.

Rows
This rule checks whether each TR in a table is a child of Table, THead, TBody, or TFoot.

Headers
For accessibility, it's necessary that all tables in the PDF have a header.
See Correct table tags with the Tags panel.
Note: See the related WCAG section: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships. (Level A)

Regularity
To be accessible, tables must contain the same number of columns in each row, and rows in each column.
See Correct table tags with the Tags panel.
Note: See the related WCAG section: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships. (Level A)

Summary
Table summaries are optional, but can improve accessibility.
1 Choose Tools &amp;gt; Accessibility &amp;gt; Reading Order.
2 Select the table by drawing a rectangle around it.
3 In the Touch UP Reading Order dialog box, click Table.
4 Right-click (Windows) or Ctrl-click (Mac OS) Table.
5 Click Edit Table Summary.
6 Enter a summary and click OK.

Note: See the related WCAG section: 1.3.1 Info and Relationships. (Level A)

Lists

List items
The check reports whether each List Item (LI) is a child of List (L). When this rule check fails, the structure of this list
is incorrect. Lists must have the following structure: A List element must contain List Item Elements. And, List Item
Elements can only contain Label Elements and List Item Body Elements.
To fix the list structure:
1 Find the list in the Accessibility Checker panel by right-clicking (Windows) or Ctrl-clicking (Mac OS) the failed

element and choosing ShowIn TagsPanel.
2 Create elements, change the types of elements, or rearrange existing elements by dragging them.

Accessibility features in PDFs
A document or application is accessible if people with disabilities, such as mobility impairments, blindness, and low
vision, can use it. Accessibility features in Acrobat DC, Acrobat Reader DC, and Adobe Portable Document Format
(PDF) enable people with disabilities to use PDF documents, with or without screen readers, screen magnifiers, and
braille printers.
Making PDFs accessible tends to benefit all users. For example, the document structure that enables a screen reader to
read a PDF out loud also enables a mobile device to reflow and display the document on a small screen. Similarly, the
preset tab order of an accessible PDF form helps all users, not just users with mobility impairments, fill the form more
easily.

Last updated 5/10/2016

444
Accessibility, tags, and reflow

Accessibility features in Acrobat DC and Acrobat Reader DC fall into two broad categories. There are features to make
the reading of PDF documents more accessible, and features to create accessible PDF documents. To create accessible
PDF documents, use Acrobat, not Reader.
Features for accessible reading of PDFs

• Preferences and commands to optimize output for assistive software and devices, such as saving as accessible text
for a braille printer
• Preferences and commands to make navigation of PDFs more accessible, such as automatic scrolling and opening
PDFs to the last page read
• Accessibility Setup Assistant for easy setting of most preferences related to accessibility
• Keyboard alternates to mouse actions
• Reflow capability to display PDF text in large type and to temporarily present a multicolumn PDF in a single, easyto-read column.
• Read Out Loud text-to-speech conversion
• Support for screen readers and screen magnifiers
Features for creating accessible PDFs

• Creation of tagged PDFs from authoring applications
• Conversion of untagged PDFs to tagged PDFs
• Security setting that allows screen readers to access text while preventing users from copying, printing, editing, and
extracting text
• Ability to add text to scanned pages to improve accessibility
• (Acrobat Pro DC) Tools for editing reading order and document structure
• (Acrobat Pro DC) Tools for creating accessible PDF forms
Acrobat Standard DC provides some functionality for making existing PDFs accessible. Acrobat Pro DC enables you
to perform tasks, such as editing reading order, or editing document structure tags that are necessary to make some
PDF documents and forms accessible.

About accessible PDFs
Accessible PDFs have the following characteristics.
Searchable text

Last updated 5/10/2016

445
Accessibility, tags, and reflow

A document that consists of scanned images of text is inherently inaccessible because the content of the document is
images, not searchable text. Assistive software cannot read or extract the words, users cannot select or edit the text, and
you cannot manipulate the PDF for accessibility. Convert the scanned images of text to searchable text using optical
character recognition (OCR) before you can use other accessibility features with the document.
Alternate text descriptions (Acrobat Pro DC)
Screen readers cannot read document features such as images and interactive form fields unless they have associated
alternate text. Screen readers can read web links; however, you can provide more meaningful descriptions as alternate
text. Alternate text and tool tips can aid many users, including users with learning disabilities.
Fonts that allow characters to be extracted to text (Acrobat Pro DC)
The fonts in an accessible PDF must contain enough information for Acrobat to extract all of the characters to text for
purposes other than displaying text on the screen. Acrobat extracts characters to Unicode text when you read a PDF
with a screen reader or the Read Out Loud feature. Acrobat also extracts characters to Unicode when you save as text
for a braille printer. This extraction fails if Acrobat cannot determine how to map the font to Unicode characters.
Reading order and document structure tags (Acrobat Pro DC)
To read a document’s text and present it in a way that makes sense to the user, a screen reader or other text-to-speech
tool requires a structured document. Document structure tags in a PDF define the reading order and identify headings,
paragraphs, sections, tables, and other page elements.
Interactive form fields (Acrobat Pro DC)
Some PDFs contain forms that a person is to fill out using a computer. To be accessible, form fields must be interactive
to let the user enter values into the form fields.
Navigational aids (Acrobat Pro DC)
Navigational aids in a PDF include links, bookmarks, headings, table of contents, and preset tab order for form fields.
Navigational aids assist users in understanding the document without reading completely through it. Bookmarks are
especially useful and can be created from document headings.
Document language (Acrobat Pro DC)
Specifying the document language in a PDF enables some screen readers to switch to the appropriate language.
Security that doesn’t interfere with assistive software (Acrobat Pro DC)
Some PDF authors restrict users from printing, copying, extracting, adding comments, or editing text. The text of an
accessible PDF must be available to a screen reader. You can use Acrobat to ensure that security settings don’t interfere
with the screen reader’s ability to convert onscreen text to speech.
For more information about PDF accessibility, see www.webaim.org/techniques/acrobat/.

About tags, accessibility, reading order, and reflow
PDF tags are similar in many ways to XML tags. PDF tags indicate document structure: which text is a heading, which
content makes up a section, which text is a bookmark, and so on. A logical structure tree of tags represents the
organizational structure of the document. Therefore, tags indicate the reading order and improve navigation,
particularly for long, complex documents without changing the PDF appearance.

Last updated 5/10/2016

446
Accessibility, tags, and reflow

Assistive software determines how to present and interpret the content of the document by using the logical structure
tree. Most assistive software depends on document structure tags to determine the appropriate reading order of text.
Document structure tags let assistive software convey the meaning of images and other content in an alternate format,
such as sound. An untagged document does not have structure information, and Acrobat must infer a structure based
on the Reading Order preference setting. This situation often results in page items being read in the wrong order or not
at all.
Reflowing a document for viewing on the small screen of a mobile device relies on these same document structure tags.
Often, Acrobat tags PDFs when you create them. To determine whether a PDF contains tags, choose File &amp;gt; Properties,
and look at the Tagged PDF value in the Advanced pane of the Description tab.
In Acrobat Pro DC, the logical structure tree appears on the Tags panel. It shows document content as page elements
nested at various levels.

Touch Up Reading Order tool for PDFs (Acrobat Pro DC)
Touch Up Reading Order tool overview
The Touch Up Reading Order tool provides the easiest and quickest way to fix reading order and basic tagging
problems. When you select the Touch Up Reading Order tool, a dialog box opens that lets you see overlay highlights
that show the order of page content. Each highlighted region is numbered and highlighted with gray or colored blocks;
the number indicates the region’s placement in the page’s reading order. After you check the reading order of the page,
you can correct other, more subtle tagging issues as needed.
The Touch Up Reading Order tool is intended for repairing PDFs that were tagged using Acrobat, not for repairing
PDFs that were tagged during conversion from an authoring application. Whenever possible, return to the source file
and add accessibility features in the authoring application. Repairing the original file ensures that you don’t have to
repeatedly touch up future iterations of the PDF in Acrobat.
You use the Touch Up Reading Order tool to perform the following accessibility tasks:

• Visually check, and then repair, the reading order of page content
• Tag fillable form fields and their labels
• Add alternate text to figures and descriptions to form fields
• Fix the tagging of simple tables, and prepare complex tables for more advanced manipulation in the logical structure
tree
• Remove nonessential content, such as ornamental page borders, from the logical structure tree

Last updated 5/10/2016

447
Accessibility, tags, and reflow

To perform advanced reading order and tagging tasks, such as fixing complex tables, removing obsolete tags, and
adding alternate text to links, use the Tags panel. The panel contains an alternate set of tools and features for
manipulating PDF tags. For more information, see Edit tags with the Tags panel.

Select the Touch Up Reading Order tool
• Choose Tools &amp;gt; Accessibility &amp;gt; Touch Up Reading Order to select the Touch Up Reading Order tool.

Tips for using the Touch Up Reading Order tool
• Save the document (or a copy of it) before you use the Touch Up Reading Order tool. You can’t use Undo to reverse
changes made with this tool, so reverting to a saved document is the only way to undo such a change.
• Choose View &amp;gt; Page Display &amp;gt; Single Page View, when using the Touch Up Reading Order tool. When you click
the Clear Page Structure button, Acrobat DC clears tags from all visible pages, even pages that are only partially
visible.
For additional tips on working with reading order, see Donna Baker’s Setting Reading Order in a PDF Document.

Touch Up Reading Order options
You can select Touch Up Reading Order options from the dialog box, from the pop-up menu that appears when you
right-click a highlighted region, or from the options menu in the Order panel. The Touch Up Reading Order tool
includes the following options:
Text Tags the selection as text.
Figure Tags the selection as a figure. Text contained within a figure tag is defined as part of the image and screen

readers don’t read it.
Form Field Tags the selection as a form field.
Figure/Caption Tags a selected figure and caption as a single tag. Any text contained in the tag is defined as a caption.

Useful for tagging photos and captions and preventing caption text from being incorrectly added to adjacent text
blocks. Figures may require alternate text.
Heading 1, Heading 2, Heading 3, Heading 4, Heading 5, Heading 6 Tags the selection as a first, second, third, fourth,

fifth, or sixth level heading tag. You can convert heading tags to bookmarks to help users navigate the document.
Table Tags the selection as a table after the selection is analyzed to determine the location of headings, columns, and

rows.
Cell Tags the selection as a table or header cell. Use this option to merge cells that are incorrectly split.
Formula Tags the selection as a formula. Because speech software may handle formula tags differently from normal

text, you may want to add a description using alternate text.
Background Tags the selection as a background element, or artifact, removing the item from the tag tree. That way, it
doesn’t appear in the reflowed document and screen readers don’t read it.
Table Editor Automatically analyzes the selected table into cells and applies the appropriate tags. The table must be
tagged as a table before you can use the Table Editor command on it.
Show Page Content Groups Shows content elements as highlighted areas that contain numbers to indicate the reading

order. Specify the highlight color by clicking the color swatch.
Show Table Cells Highlights the content of individual table cells. Specify the highlight color by clicking the color

swatch.

Display Like Elements In A Single Block Adjacent squares with the same tag type are collapsed into a single, bigger

square with the common tag type that encompasses the original square.
Show Tables And Figures Outlines each table and figure with a crossed-out box. The box also indicates whether the
element includes alternate text. Specify the box color by clicking the color swatch.
Clear Page Structure Removes the tagging structure from the page. Use this option to start over and create a new
structure if the existing structure contains too many problems.
Show Order Panel Opens the Order tab for reordering highlighted content.
Edit Alternate Text Available in the menu that appears when you right-click a highlighted figure. Allows the user to add
or edit a text description about the figure properties that a screen reader or other assistive technology reads.
Edit Form Field Text Available in the menu that appears when you right-click a form field. Allows the user to add or
edit a form field text description that a screen reader or other assistive technology reads.
Edit Table Summary Available in the menu that appears when you right-click a highlighted table. Allows the user to

add or edit a text description about the table properties that a screen reader or other assistive technology reads.

Check and correct reading order (Acrobat Pro DC)
You can quickly check the reading order of tagged PDFs by using the Touch Up Reading Order tool. You can also use
this tool to add alternate text to images and correct many types of tagging problems that are outlined in the report that
Acrobat generates when you add tags to a PDF.
Reading-order problems are readily apparent when you use the Touch Up Reading Order tool. Each section of
contiguous page content appears as a separate highlighted region and is numbered according to its placement in the
reading order. Within each region, text is ordered left to right and top to bottom. (You can change this order in the
Touch Up preferences.) If a single highlighted region contains two columns of text or text that won’t flow normally,
divide the region into parts that can be reordered. Because highlighted regions are rectangular, they may overlap
somewhat, especially if their page content is irregularly shaped. Unless page content overlaps or is contained within two
highlighted regions, no reading order problem is indicated. Page content should belong to no more than one
highlighted region.
You can change the reading order of the highlighted regions by moving an item in the Order panel or by dragging it on
the page in the document pane. By reordering highlighted regions on the page, you can make a figure and caption read
at the specific point that they are referenced in the text. By changing the order of a highlighted region, you effectively
change the reading order of that item without changing the actual appearance of the PDF.

Check reading order with the Touch Up Reading Order tool
1 Select the Touch Up Reading Order tool.
2 In the Touch Up Reading Order dialog box, select Show Page Content Groups, and then click Page Content Order.

Note: If highlighted regions don’t appear in the document pane, the document doesn’t contain tags.
3 Optionally, do any of the following:

• To specify a highlight color, click the color swatch, and then click the color you want.
• To highlight tables and figures, and to view alternate text for figures, select Show Tables And Figures.
4 Check the reading order of text within each highlighted region.

Zooming in can make this step easier.

new reading order. You can select and move multiple, adjacent regions.

Change the reading order by dragging on the page
1 Select the Touch Up Reading Order tool.
2 In the Touch Up Reading Order dialog box, select Show Page Content Groups, and then click Page Content Order.
3 In the document pane, place the pointer over the number for the highlighted region you want to move. Thenh, drag

it to where you want it to be read. The text-insertion pointer shows target locations within the text.
When you release the highlighted region, the location of the text-insertion pointer becomes the dividing line. The
underlying highlighted region is split into two new highlighted regions. All highlighted regions are renumbered to
show the new reading order.

Edit tags with the Touch Up Reading Order tool (Acrobat Pro DC)
You can use the Touch Up Reading Order tool to create tags in untagged PDFs or to add new tags to an existing
structure. However, this manual tagging doesn’t provide the same level of detail to the tagging structure as the Add Tags
To Document command, such as paragraphs, bulleted and numbered lists, line breaks, and hyphens. Before you clear
the existing structure, make sure that manual tagging is your only recourse.

• Drag to select it.
• Click the number of a highlighted region.
4 Click the button for the tag type that you want for the highlighted region.

Add or remove content from a tagged region
The Touch Up Reading Order tool always displays as few highlighted regions as possible. If content within a highlighted
region doesn’t flow properly, you may need to split a region to reorder it. Highlighted regions may also contain adjacent
page content that is unrelated or that requires a different tag type. Page content may become orphaned from related
elements, particularly if the content doesn’t fit within a rectangular shape. Use the Touch Up Reading Order tool to add
or remove content from a region, or to split a region to reorder the content.
1 Select the Touch Up Reading Order tool.
2 In the Touch Up Reading Order dialog box, select Show Page Content Groups, and then click Page Content Order.
3 In the document pane, select a highlighted region.
4 Do one of the following:

• To add content to the current selection, Shift-click the content you want to add. The pointer changes to include
a plus sign (+).
• To remove content from the current selection, Ctrl-click the content you want to remove. The pointer changes
to include a minus sign (-).
5 Click the button for the tag type that you want for the highlighted region.

Split a region into two regions
1 Select the Touch Up Reading Order tool.
2 In the Touch Up Reading Order dialog box, select Show Page Content Groups, and then click Page Content Order.
3 In the document pane, drag to select a small portion of content near the boundary of the first region that you want

Remove page elements from the tag structure
When tagging a PDF, Acrobat can’t always distinguish between instructive figures and decorative page elements. Items
that visually enhance page layout, such as decorative borders, lines, or background elements, can add clutter to the
structure layout and should be removed. Therefore, Acrobat may incorrectly tag artifacts or page elements as figure
tags. You can remove artifacts and irrelevant page elements from the tag structure by redefining them with the
Background tag or by deleting their tags. If a tagged image in the document doesn’t contain useful or illustrative
information for the user, you can remove the element from the tagging structure so that it isn’t read out loud or
reflowed.
1 Select the Touch Up Reading Order tool.
2 In the Touch Up Reading Order dialog box, select Show Page Content Groups, and click Page Content Order. Then,

select Show Tables And Figures.
3 Remove the page element by doing one of the following:

• In the document pane, select the page element, and then click Background in the dialog box.
• In the Order panel, select the page element, and then press Delete.

Edit tags for figures and tables (Acrobat Pro DC)
You can use the Touch Up Reading Order tool to add and edit tags and alternate text for figures and tables.

Apply a figure tag
You can select an element and define it as a figure by using the Touch Up Reading Order tool. Once you define it as a
figure, you can add alternate text to describe the figure.
1 Using the Touch Up Reading Order tool, select the figure.
2 In the Touch Up Reading Order dialog box, click Figure.
3 In the document pane, right-click the region and choose Edit Alternate Text.
4 Enter alternate text, and click OK.

Check and correct figure tags
You can use the Touch Up Reading Order tool to identify and correct tagging results for figures. Determine whether
figures include or require alternate text necessary to be read correctly with assistive technologies. Ideally, figure tags
should identify image content that is meaningful to the document as a whole, such as graphs or illustrative photographs.
If background elements that shouldn’t be read are tagged as figures, redefine them as background.
1 Select the Touch Up Reading Order tool, and then click Show Tables And Figures in the dialog box.
2 Do any of the following:

• If a figure isn’t tagged as a figure, select the content region you want, and then click Figure or Figure/Caption in
the dialog box.
• To remove text that was incorrectly combined with a figure, drag to select the text, and click the Text button in
the dialog box.
• To include a caption that is grouped with the figure, select the figure and caption, and click the Figure/Caption
button in the dialog box.

Check and add alternate text for figures
If you want screen readers to describe graphical elements that illustrate important concepts in a document, you must
provide the description using alternate text. Figures aren’t recognized or read by a screen reader unless you add
alternate text to the tag properties. If you apply alternate text to text elements, only the description, not the actual text,
is read.
1 Select the Touch Up Reading Order tool.
2 Select Show Tables And Figures in the dialog box.
3 Right-click the figure, and choose Edit Alternate Text from the pop-up menu.
4 In the Edit Alternate Text dialog box, type a new (or edit an existing) description for the figure, and then click OK.

Edit table tags and tag unrecognized tables
Tables pose a special challenge for screen readers because they present textual or numerical data to be easily referenced
visually. Content within table cells can be complex and might contain lists, paragraphs, form fields, or another table.
For best results when tagging tables, use the application that you created the document with to add tags when you create
the PDF. If a PDF isn’t tagged, you can add tags by using the Add Tags To Document command. Most tables are properly
recognized using this command; however, the command may not recognize a table that lacks clear borders, headings,
columns, and rows. Use the Touch Up Reading Order tool to determine if the table has been properly recognized and
to correct recognition problems. To add specialized formatting to tables and table cells, use the Tags panel.
You can use the Table Editor to automatically analyze a table into its components and apply the appropriate tags, but
you may still need to check and correct some of these tags manually. By viewing table tags, you can determine whether
columns, rows, and cells have been correctly identified. Tables that lack well-defined borders and rules are often tagged
incorrectly or contain adjacent page elements. You can correct poorly tagged tables by selecting and redefining them;
you can split combined cells by creating a tag for each cell.
To correct complex tagging problems for tables, you often must use the Tags panel.
1 Select the Touch Up Reading Order tool, and then click Show Tables And Figures.
2 If the table isn’t clearly labeled in the document pane, drag to select the entire table, and then click Table in the dialog

box.
3 Click Show Table Cells to make sure that all cells in the table are defined as individual elements.
4 If cells don’t appear as separate elements, do one of the following:

• If one or more cells are merged, use the Touch Up Reading Order tool to select the area within a single cell, and
then click Cell in the dialog box. Repeat for each merged cell.
• If cells aren’t highlighted, the table might not use standard table formatting. Re-create the table in the authoring
application.
5 If the table contains cells that are intended to span across two or more columns, set ColSpan and RowSpan attributes

for these rows in the tag structure.

Remove or replace document structure tags (Acrobat Pro DC)
If adding tags to a PDF in Adobe Acrobat results in a tagging structure that is overly complicated or too problematic to
fix, you can use the Touch Up Reading Order tool to remove or replace the current structure. If the document contains
mostly text, you can select a page and then remove headings, tables, and other elements to create a cleaner, simpler
tagging structure.
Acrobat can retag an already tagged document after you first remove all existing tags from the tree.

column must be selected and tagged individually.
1 Select the tool.
2 In the document pane, drag to select the entire page. The selection includes both text and nontext elements.
3 Ctrl-drag around nontext page elements, such as figures and captions, to deselect them, until only text is selected on

the page. Click Text in the Touch Up Reading Order dialog box.
4 In the document pane, select a nontext page element, such as a figure and caption, and click the appropriate button

in the dialog box to tag it. Repeat until all page content is tagged.

Acrobat provides several preferences that help make the reading of PDFs more accessible for visually impaired and
motion-impaired users. These preferences control how PDFs appear on the screen and how they are read by a screen
reader.
Most preferences related to accessibility are available through the Accessibility Setup Assistant, which provides
onscreen instructions for setting these preferences. Some preferences that affect accessibility aren’t available through
the Accessibility Setup Assistant including preferences in the Reading, Forms, and Multimedia categories. You can set
all preferences in the Preferences dialog box.
The names shown for some preferences in the Accessibility Setup Assistant are different from the names for the same

Infer Reading Order From Document (Recommended) Interprets the reading order of untagged documents by using an

advanced method of structure-inference layout analysis.
Left-To-Right, Top-To-Bottom Reading Order Delivers the text according to its placement on the page, reading from left
to right and then top to bottom. This method is faster than Infer Reading Order From Document. This method analyzes
text only; form fields are ignored and tables aren’t recognized as such.
Use Reading Order In Raw Print Stream Delivers text in the order in which it was recorded in the print stream. This
method is faster than Infer Reading Order From Document. This method analyzes text only; form fields are ignored
and tables aren’t recognized as such.
Override The Reading Order In Tagged Documents Uses the reading order specified in the Reading preferences instead

what the tag structure of the document specifies. Use this preference only when you encounter problems in poorly
tagged PDFs. This preference corresponds to the Override The Reading Order In Tagged Documents option in the
Accessibility Setup Assistant.
Page Vs Document This preference determines how much of a document is delivered to a screen reader at a time. If a

PDF isn’t tagged, Acrobat may analyze the document and attempt to infer its structure and reading order. This process
can take a long time for a long document. Consider setting Acrobat to deliver only the currently visible page so that it
analyzes only a small piece of the document at a time. This consideration varies depending on the size and complexity
of the document and on the features of the screen reader. When Acrobat delivers information to a screen reader, screen
magnifier, or other assistive software, it loads information into a memory buffer that is directly available to the assistive
software. The amount of information that is delivered to the memory buffer can affect how long Acrobat takes to
perform tasks, such as opening the document, advancing to the next page, changing views, and carrying out
commands.
Only Read The Currently Visible Pages This option is usually best when you use a screen magnifier. It improves

performance by eliminating the need for the software to process parts of the document that aren’t visible. When
Acrobat sends only the currently visible pages of a PDF to the memory buffer, the assistive technology has access to
those pages only. It cannot go to another page until the next page is visible and Acrobat has sent the page information
to the memory buffer. Therefore, if this option is selected, you must use the navigation features of Acrobat, not the
features of the assistive technology, to navigate from page to page in the document. Also set theDefault Page Layout
option in preferences to Single Page if you choose to have Acrobat send only the currently visible pages to the assistive

technology. Because Acrobat sends page information about all visible pages, the assistive technology receives
information about pages that may be only partially visible (such as the bottom of one page or the top of the next), as
well as those pages that are completely visible. If you use a page display setting other than Single Page, such as
Continuous, and then you display the next page, the technology may not correctly track which portion of a previous
page it has already read aloud. For instructions on setting the default page layout to Single Page, see Preferences for
viewing PDFs.
This option corresponds to the Only Read The Currently Visible Pages option in the Accessibility Setup Assistant.
Read The Entire Document This option can be best if you use a screen reader that has its own navigation and search

tools and that is more familiar to you than the tools in Acrobat. This option corresponds to the Read The Entire
Document At Once option in the Accessibility Setup Assistant.
For Large Documents, Only Read The Currently Visible Pages This option is selected by default and is usually best if

you use a screen reader with long or complex PDFs. It allows Acrobat to deliver an entire small document but revert to
page-by-page delivery for large documents. This preference corresponds to the For Large Documents, Only Read The
Currently Visible Pages option in the Accessibility Setup Assistant.
Confirm Before Tagging Documents When selected, lets the user confirm the options that are used before Acrobat

prepares an untagged document for reading. Tagging can be a time-consuming procedure, especially for larger
documents. This preference corresponds to the Confirm Before Tagging Documents option in the Accessibility Setup
Assistant.
Read Out Loud Options Set preferences in to control volume, speed, and pitch of the voice used for Read Out Loud. You

can choose to use the default voice or any of the voices that your operating system provides. You can also use the up
and down arrows to read blocks of text. These preferences do not have corresponding options in the Accessibility Setup
Assistant.

Navigate and control the application with the keyboard
You can navigate by using the keyboard instead of the mouse. Several keyboard access features are available in Mac OS;
see the documentation for your operating system for details. In Windows, some of the keyboard shortcuts used to
navigate in Acrobat differ from the keyboard shortcuts used in other Windows applications.
When you open Acrobat within a web browser, keyboard commands are mapped to the web browser first.
Consequently, some keyboard shortcuts are not available in Acrobat or are available only after you shift the focus to the
PDF.
For information about accessibility features, see www.adobe.com/accessibility.

Enable single-key accelerators
You can select some tools and perform some actions with single-key accelerators. Most keyboard shortcuts in Acrobat
don’t require that you enable single-key accelerators.
In the Preferences dialog box under Categories, select General, and then select Use Single-Key Accelerators To
Access Tools.
Note: Some screen readers do not work with Acrobat single-key accelerators.

Save as accessible text for a braille printer
Note: This document uses the term “braille printer” to refer to any device that is used to convert accessible text to a form
that a person with blindness or low vision can use.
You can save a PDF as accessible text to print on a braille printer. Accessible text can be imported and printed out as
formatted grade 1 or 2 braille documents by using a braille translation application. See the documentation included
with the braille translator for more information.
A text version of a PDF contains no images or multimedia objects. However, the text version of an accessible PDF
contains alternate text descriptions for such objects if they have been provided.
Choose File &amp;gt; Export To &amp;gt; Text (Accessible).

Reflow a PDF
You can reflow a PDF to temporarily present it as a single column that is the width of the document pane. This reflow
view can make the document easier to read on a mobile device or magnified on a standard monitor, without scrolling
horizontally to read the text.
You cannot save, edit, or print a document while it is in Reflow view.
In most cases, only readable text appears in the reflow view. Text that doesn’t reflow includes forms, comments, digital
signature fields, and page artifacts, such as page numbers, headers, and footers. Pages that contain both readable text
and form or digital signature fields don’t reflow. Vertical text reflows horizontally.
Acrobat temporarily tags an untagged document before reflowing it. As an author, you can optimize your PDFs for
reflow by tagging them yourself. Tagging ensures that text blocks reflow and that content follows the appropriate
sequences, so readers can follow a story that spans different pages and columns without other stories interrupting the
flow.
To quickly check the reading order of a document, view it in Reflow view.
(Acrobat Pro) If the tagged PDF doesn’t reflow the way you want, see if the content order or reading order of the PDF
file contains inconsistencies. Also check the tagging process. You can use the Content pane or the Touch Up Reading
Order tool to resolve reflow problems.

Reading a PDF with a screen reader
Acrobat supports assistive software and devices, such as screen readers and screen magnifiers, that enable visually
impaired users to interact with computer applications. When assistive software and devices are in use, Acrobat adds
temporary tags to open PDFs to improve their readability. Use the Accessibility Setup Assistant to improve how Acrobat
interacts with the types of assistive software and devices that you use. When using a screen reader, you can change your
reading settings for the current document by choosing Tools &amp;gt; Accessibility &amp;gt; Change Reading Options.
See the documentation for your assistive software or device. Or, contact the vendor for more information about system
requirements, compatibility requirements, and instructions for using this software or device with Acrobat.
For more information about using screen readers, see www.adobe.com/accessibility/pdfs/accessing-pdf-sr.pdf.

Read a PDF with Read Out Loud
The Read Out Loud feature reads aloud the text in a PDF, including the text in comments and alternate text descriptions
for images and fillable fields. In tagged PDFs, content is read in the order in which it appears in the document’s logical
structure tree. In untagged documents, the reading order is inferred, unless a reading order has been specified in the
Reading preferences.
Read Out Loud uses the available voices installed on your system. If you have SAPI 4 or SAPI 5 voices installed from
text-to-speech or language applications, you can choose them to read your PDFs.
Note: Read Out Loud isn’t a screen reader, and some operating systems don’t support it.

Correct reflow problems with the Content panel
Use the Content panel to correct reflow problems in a PDF that can’t be corrected by using the Touch Up Reading Order
tool. Because you can damage a PDF by editing content objects, make sure that you’re familiar with PDF structure
before you change anything. For comprehensive information about PDF structure, see the PDF Reference Sixth Edition:
Adobe Portable Document Format Version 1.7, on the PDF reference page (English only) of the Adobe website.
The Content panel provides a hierarchical view of the objects that make up a PDF, including the PDF object itself. Each
document includes one or more pages, a set of annotations (such as comments and links), and the content objects for
the page. The content objects consist of containers, text, paths, and images. Objects are listed in the order in which they
appear on the page, like tags in the logical structure tree. However, PDFs don’t require tags for you to view or change
the object structure.
Choose View &amp;gt; Show/Hide &amp;gt; Navigation Panels &amp;gt; Content.

2 Move a container or object by selecting it and doing one of the following:

• Drag it to the location you want.
• Choose Cut from the options menu, select the tag above the location you want to paste the cut tag, and choose
Paste from the options menu.
Note: Container elements can’t be pasted directly to page elements. To move a container to another page, cut the
container you want to move. Then select a container on the page you want to move the container to and choose Paste
from the options menu. Then, drag the container out one level to the location that you want.

About the Tags panel
The Tags panel allows you to view and edit tags in the logical structure tree, or tags tree, of a PDF. In the Tags panel,
tags appear in a hierarchical order that indicates the reading sequence of the document. The first item in this structure
is the Tags root. All other items are tags and are children of the Tags root. Tags use coded element types that appear in
angle brackets (&amp;lt; &amp;gt;). Each element, including structural elements such as sections and articles, appears in the logical
structure order by type, followed by a title and the element’s content or a description of the content. Structural elements
are typically listed as containers (parent tags). They include several smaller elements (child tags) within them.
Note: For more information on logical structures, see the PDF Reference Sixth Edition: Adobe Portable Document Format
Version 1.7, on the PDF reference page (English only) of the Adobe website.
Though you can correct most tagging issues by using the Touch Up Reading Order tool, you must use the Tags panel
to address detailed tagging of tables and substructure items, such as paragraphs, lists, and sections that require multiple
languages. Add tags manually to a document in the Tags panel only as a last resort. First consider using the Add Tags
To Document command.
Note: Operations performed in the Tags panel cannot be undone with the Undo command. Save a backup copy of a
document before you begin work on it in the Tags panel.

Add alternate text and supplementary information to tags
Some tagged PDFs might not contain all the information necessary to make the document contents fully accessible. For
example, if you want to make a document available to a screen reader, the PDF should contain alternate text for figures,
language properties for portions of the text that use a different language than the default language for the document,
and expansion text for abbreviations. Designating the appropriate language for different text elements ensures that the
correct characters are used when you repurpose the document and that it is spell-checked with the correct dictionary.
You can add alternate text and multiple languages to a tag from the Tags panel. (If only one language is required, choose
the language with File &amp;gt; Properties instead.) You can also add alternate text by using the Touch Up Reading Order tool.
Note: Keep alternate text descriptions as concise as possible.

Add alternate text to links
Screen readers can read the URLs of web links out loud, but adding meaningful alternate text to links can help users
immensely. For example, by adding alternate text you can have a screen reader tell a user to “go to the Acrobat
accessibility page of adobe.com” rather than “go to http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/solutionsacc.html.”
You add alternate text to the &amp;lt;Link&amp;gt; tag of a link.
Note: Add alternate text only to tags that don’t have child tags. Adding alternate text to a parent tag prevents a screen
reader from reading any of that tag’s child tags.
1 In the tag tree, select the &amp;lt;Link&amp;gt; tag for the link, and select Properties from the options menu.
2 In the Touch Up Properties dialog box, select the Tag panel.
3 Type alternate text for the link, and click Close.

Add alternate text for a figure
Choose View &amp;gt; Show/Hide &amp;gt; Navigation Panels &amp;gt; Tags.
1 Expand the logical structure tree to find and select the &amp;lt;Figure&amp;gt; tag element for the image.

To find a tag more easily, use the Touch Up Reading Order tool to select the figure or text near the figure in the
document pane. Then, choose Find Tag From Selection from the options menu in the Tags panel.

3 Choose Properties from the options menu in the Tags panel.
4 In the Touch Up Properties dialog box, click the Tag panel.
5 For Alternate Text, type text that describes the figure.

Add alternate text for an abbreviated term
1 In the Tags panel, locate the abbreviated term by doing one of the following:

• Expand the tag tree as needed to see the elements that contain the abbreviation.
• Use the Touch Up Text tool or the Select tool to select the abbreviation in the document, and then choose Find
Tag From Selection from the options menu to locate the text in the tag tree.
2 Select the tag for that element, and choose Properties from the options menu.

Note: If the abbreviation includes additional text, cut the additional text and place it in a new &amp;lt;Span&amp;gt; child tag within
the same &amp;lt;Span&amp;gt; parent tag.
3 In the Touch Up Properties dialog box, select the Tag panel.
4 For Alternate Text, type the unabbreviated version of the term.
5 Click Close.

Create a new child tag
1 In the Tags panel, select the parent node (the icon at the same level at which you want to create a child tag) in the

Tags tree for which you want to create a child tag.
Choose New Tag from the options menu.
2 Select the appropriate tag type from the Type pop-up menu, or type a custom tag type, name the tag (optional), and

then click OK.

Add tags to comments
When you tag a PDF that includes comments, the comments are tagged as well. However, if you add comments to a
PDF that’s already tagged, your comments are untagged unless you enable comment tagging first.
Note: To Enable comment tagging in a PDF, in the Tags panel, choose Tag Annotations from the options menu. Comments
or markups that you add to the PDF are tagged automatically.
If a document contains untagged comments, you can locate them in the logical structure tree and tag them by using the
Find command in the Tags panel.
1 In the Tags panel, choose Find from the options menu.
2 In the Find Element dialog box, choose Unmarked Comments from the Find pop-up menu, and click Find.
3 When the comment type appears in the Type field (for example, Text), click Tag Element, choose Annotation from

the Type pop-up menu in the New Tag dialog box, and then click OK.
4 In the Find Element dialog box, click Find Next to locate and tag all comments, and then click Close.

Correct table tags with the Tags panel
Use the Touch Up Reading Order tool to make sure that tables are tagged correctly. If you need to structure figures and
text within the cells of your table, you may prefer to re-create the table in the authoring application before you convert
it as an accessible PDF. Adding tags on a cell level in Acrobat is a labor-intensive procedure.
Before you make any changes to table elements, use the Touch Up Reading Order tool to determine that the table is
tagged correctly.

Check table elements
1 In the Tags panel, expand the tags root to view a table tag.
2 Select the table tag &amp;lt;Table&amp;gt; and verify that it contains one of the following elements:

• Table Rows, each of which contains Table Header &amp;lt;TH&amp;gt; or Table Data&amp;lt;TD&amp;gt; cells.
• &amp;lt;THead&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;TBody&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;TFoot&amp;gt; sections, each of which containsTable Rows. (The Table Rows contain &amp;lt;TH&amp;gt;
cells, &amp;lt;TD&amp;gt; cells, or both.)
3 Do one or more of the following:

• If the tag for the table doesn’t contain these elements, but rows, columns, and cells appear in the table in the
document pane, use the Touch Up Reading Order tool to select and define the table or individual cells.
• If the table contains rows that span two or more columns, set ColSpan and RowSpan attributes for these rows in
the tag structure.
• Re-create the table in the authoring application, and then convert it to a tagged PDF.

Set ColSpan and RowSpan attributes
1 In the Tags panel, select a &amp;lt;TD&amp;gt; or &amp;lt;TH&amp;gt; element.
2 Choose Properties from the options menu.
3 In the Touch Up Properties dialog box, click the Tag panel, and then click Edit Attribute Objects.
4 Select Attribute Objects, and then click New Item to create a new Attribute Object Dictionary.
5 Expand the new dictionary, select the Layout attribute, and then click Change Item.
6 Change the Layout value to Table.
7 Select the Attribute Object Dictionary, and click New Item.
8 In the Add Key And Value dialog box, type ColSpan or RowSpan in the Key box, enter the number of columns or

rows spanned in the Value box, choose Integer from the Value Type pop-up menu, and click OK.

Standard PDF tags
This section describes the standard tag types that apply to tagged PDFs. These standard tags provide assistive software
and devices with semantic and structural elements to use to interpret document structure and present content in a
useful manner.
The PDF tags architecture is extensible, so any PDF document can contain any tag set that an authoring application
decides to use. For example, a PDF can have XML tags that came in from an XML schema. Custom tags that you define
(such as tag names generated from paragraph styles of an authoring application) need a role map. The role map matches
each custom tag to a standard tag here. When assistive software encounters a custom tag, the software can check this
role map and properly interpret the tags. Tagging PDFs by using one of the methods described here generally produces
a correct role map for the document.

Last updated 5/10/2016

Accessibility, tags, and reflow

Note: You can view and edit the role map of a PDF by choosing Options &amp;gt; Edit Role Map in the Tags panel.
The standard Adobe element tag types are available in the New Tag dialog box. They are also available in the Touch Up
Properties dialog box in Acrobat Pro. Adobe strongly encourages using these tag types because they provide the best
results when tagged content is converted to a different format. These formats include HTML, Microsoft Word, or an
accessible text format for use by other assistive technologies.
Block-level elements are page elements that consist of text laid out in paragraph-like forms. Block-level elements are
part of a document’s logical structure. Such elements are further classified as container elements, heading and
paragraph elements, label and list elements, special text elements, and table elements.

Container elements
Container elements are the highest level of element and provide hierarchical grouping for other block-level elements.
Document Document element. The root element of a document’s tag tree.
Part Part element. A large division of a document; may group smaller units of content together, such as division

elements, article elements, or section elements.
Div Division element. A generic block-level element or group of block-level elements.
Art Article element. A self-contained body of text considered to be a single narrative.
Sect Section element. A general container element type, comparable to Division (DIV Class=“Sect”) in HTML, which

is usually a component of a part element or an article element.

Heading and paragraph elements
Heading and paragraph elements are paragraph-like, block-level elements that include specific level heading and
generic paragraph (P) tags. A heading (H) element should appear as the first child of any higher-level division. Six levels
of headings (H1 to H6) are available for applications that don’t hierarchically nest sections.

Label and list elements
Label and list elements are block-level elements used for structuring lists.
L List element. Any sequence of items of similar meaning or other relevance; immediate child elements should be list

item elements.
LI List item element. Any one member of a list; may have a label element (optional) and a list body element (required)
as a child.
LBL Label element. A bullet, name, or number that identifies and distinguishes an element from others in the same list.
LBody List item body element. The descriptive content of a list item.

Special text elements
Special text elements identify text that isn’t used as a generic paragraph (P).
BlockQuote Block quote element. One or more paragraphs of text attributed to someone other than the author of the

immediate surrounding text.
Caption Caption element. A brief portion of text that describes a table or a figure.
Index Index element. A sequence of entries that contain identifying text and reference elements that point out the

occurrence of the text in the main body of the document.
TOC Table of contents element. An element that contains a structured list of items and labels identifying those items;

has its own discrete hierarchy.

Last updated 5/10/2016

467
Accessibility, tags, and reflow

TOCI Table of contents item element. An item contained in a list associated with a table of contents element.

Table elements
Table elements are special elements for structuring tables.
Table Table element. A two-dimensional arrangement of data or text cells that contains table row elements as child

elements and may have a caption element as its first or last child element.
TR Table row element. One row of headings or data in a table; may contain table header cell elements and table data

cell elements.
TD Table data cell element. A table cell that contains nonheader data.
TH Table header cell element. A table cell that contains header text or data describing one or more rows or columns of

a table.

Inline-level elements
Inline-level elements identify a span of text that has specific formatting or behavior. They are differentiated from blocklevel elements. Inline-level elements may be contained in or contain block-level elements.
BibEntry Bibliography entry element. A description of where some cited information may be found.
Quote Quote entry element. An inline portion of text that is attributed to someone other than the author of the text

surrounding it; different from a block quote, which is a whole paragraph or multiple paragraphs, as opposed to inline
text.
Span Span entry element. Any inline segment of text; commonly used to delimit text that is associated with a set of
styling properties.

Special inline-level elements
Similar to inline-level elements, special inline-level elements describe an inline portion of text that has special
formatting or behavior.
Code Code entry element. Computer program text embedded within a document.
Figure Figure entry element. A graphic or graphic representation associated with text.
Form Form entry element. A PDF form annotation that can be or has been filled out.
Formula Formula entry element. A mathematical formula.
Link Link entry element. A hyperlink that is embedded within a document. The target can be in the same document,
in another PDF document, or on a website.
Note Note entry element. Explanatory text or documentation, such as a footnote or endnote, that is referred to in the

main body of text.
Reference Reference entry element. A citation to text or data that is found elsewhere in the document.

Creating accessible PDFs
Workflow for creating accessible PDFs
At a high level, the process of creating accessible PDFs consists of a few basic stages:
1 Consider accessibility before you convert a document to PDF.
2 As needed, add fillable form fields and descriptions, and set the tab order.
3 Add other accessibility features to the PDF.
4 Tag the PDF.
5 Evaluate the PDF and repair tagging problems.

These stages are presented in an order that suits most needs. However, you can perform tasks in a different order or
iterate between some of the stages. In all cases, first examine the document, determine its intended purpose, and use
that analysis to determine the workflow that you apply.

Additional resources
For more information about creating accessible PDFs, see these resources:

• Guide to creating accessible electronic documents, including
PDFs:http://www.section508.gov/content/build/create-accessible-documents/
• Best practices: amp.ssbbartgroup.com

Consider accessibility before you convert a document to PDF
Whenever possible, think about accessibility when you create the source files in an authoring application, such as a
word-processing or page-layout application.
Typical tasks in the authoring application include adding alternate text to graphics, optimizing tables, and applying
paragraph styles or other document-structure features that can be converted to tags. For more information, see
Creating a tagged PDF from an authoring application.

Add fillable form fields and descriptions, and set the tab order
If your PDF includes form fields, use Tools &amp;gt; Accessibility &amp;gt; Run Form Field Recognition to detect form fields and make
them interactive (fillable).
Use the Forms tools to create fillable form fields, such as buttons, check boxes, pop-up menus, and text boxes. When
you create a field, type a description in the Tooltip box in the Properties dialog box for that field. Screen readers read
this text aloud to the user. For more information, see Create form fields.
You can also use the Touch Up Reading Order tool in Acrobat Pro to add descriptions to form fields.
For information on setting the tab order to use document structure, see Set form field navigation.

Add other accessibility features to the PDF
In Acrobat Pro DC, this stage includes setting the document language, making sure that security settings don’t interfere
with screen readers, creating accessible links, and adding bookmarks. For more information, see Document language,
Prevent security settings from interfering with screen readers, Accessible links, and Bookmarks.
In Acrobat Standard DC, this stage includes setting the document language, making sure that security settings don’t
interfere with screen readers, and adding bookmarks. For more information, see Document language, Prevent security
settings from interfering with screen readers, and Bookmarks.

Tag the PDF
Improve the accessibility of PDFs by adding tags in Acrobat. If a PDF doesn’t contain tags, Acrobat attempts to tag it
automatically when users read or reflow it, and the results may be disappointing. With a tagged PDF, the logical
structure tree sends the contents to a screen reader or other assistive software or hardware in an appropriate order.
For best results, tag a document when converting it to PDF from an authoring application. Examples of these
applications include Adobe FrameMaker®, Adobe InDesign®,Microsoft Word, or OpenOffice Writer. If you do not have
access to an authoring application that can generate a tagged PDF, you can tag a PDF any time by using Acrobat.
Tagging during conversion to PDF requires an authoring application that supports tagging in PDF. Tagging during
conversion enables the authoring application to draw from the paragraph styles or other structural information of the
source document to produce a logical structure tree. The logical structure tree reflects an accurate reading order and
appropriate levels of tags. This tagging can more readily interpret the structure of complex layouts, such as embedded
sidebars, closely spaced columns, irregular text alignment, and tables. Tagging during conversion can also properly tag
the links, cross-references, bookmarks, and alternate text (when available) that are in the file.
To tag a PDF in Acrobat, choose Tools &amp;gt; Accessibility &amp;gt; Add Tags To Document. This command works on any untagged
PDF, such as one created with Adobe PDF Printer. Acrobat analyzes the content of the PDF to interpret the individual
page elements, their hierarchical structure, and the intended reading order of each page. Then, it builds a tag tree that
reflects that information. It also creates tags for any links, cross-references, and bookmarks that you added to the
document in Acrobat.
The Add Tags To Document command adequately tags most standard layouts. However, it cannot always correctly
interpret the structure and reading order of complex page elements. These elements include closely spaced columns,
irregular text alignment, nonfillable form fields, and tables that don’t have borders. Tagging these pages by using the
Add Tags To Document command can result in improperly combined elements or out-of-sequence tags. These issues
cause reading order problems in the PDF.

About watermarks and screen readers
You can add a watermark to a tagged PDF without adding it to the tag tree. Not having a watermark appear in the tag
tree is helpful for people who are using screen readers, because they won’t hear the watermark read as a document
content.
The best way to add a watermark that doesn’t interfere with screen readers is to insert an untagged PDF of the
watermark into a tagged PDF.

Evaluate the PDF and repair tagging problems (Acrobat Pro DC)
Once you have a tagged PDF, evaluate the document for reading order problems, tagging errors, and accessibility errors,
and then repair them as needed.

Last updated 5/10/2016

470
Accessibility, tags, and reflow

Whichever method you use to tag the PDF, use Acrobat to touch up the tagging and reading order for complex page
layouts or unusual page elements. For example, the Add Tags To Document command can’t always distinguish between
instructive figures and decorative page elements such as borders, lines, or background elements. It may incorrectly tag
all of these elements as figures. Similarly, this command may erroneously tag graphical characters within text, such as
drop caps, as figures instead of including them in the tag that represents the text block. Such errors can clutter the tag
tree and complicate the reading order that assistive technology relies on.
If you tag a document from within Acrobat, the application generates an error report after it completes the tagging
process. Use this report as a guide to repair tagging problems. You can identify other tagging, reading order, and
accessibility problems for any PDF by using the Full Check tool or the Touch Up Reading Order tool. For more
information, see Check accessibility of PDFs (Acrobat Pro DC)and Check and correct reading order (Acrobat Pro DC).

Create a tagged PDF from a web page
A PDF that you create from a web page is only as accessible as the HTML source that it is based on. For example, if the
web page relies on tables for its layout design, the HTML code for the table may not flow in the same logical reading
order as a tagged PDF would require, even though the HTML code is sufficiently structured to display all the elements
correctly in a browser.
Depending on the complexity of the web page, you can do extensive repairs in Acrobat Pro by using the Touch Up
Reading Order tool or editing the tag tree in Acrobat.
To produce the most accessible PDFs from web pages you create, first establish a logical reading order in their HTML
code. For best results, employ the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines that are published by theWorld Wide Web
Consortium (W3C). For more information, see the guidelines on the W3C website.
1 Do one of the following:

• In Acrobat, choose File &amp;gt; Create &amp;gt; PDF From Web Page, enter the web page address, and then click Settings.
• In Microsoft Internet Explorer, in the Adobe PDF toolbar, click the Down Arrow on the Convert button and
choose Preferences.
2 In the General tab, select Create PDF Tags, and then click OK.
3 Specify any other options as appropriate, and then click Create.

Creating a tagged PDF from an authoring application
In most cases, you create tagged PDFs from within an authoring application, such as Adobe FrameMaker®, Adobe
InDesign, or Microsoft Word. Creating tags in the authoring application generally provides better results than adding
tags in Acrobat.
PDFMaker provides conversion settings that let you create tagged PDFs in Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint, and Word.
For more information about creating accessible PDFs, see www.adobe.com/accessibility.
For more information, see the documentation for your authoring application.

About tags in combined PDFs
You can combine multiple files from different applications in one operation to create a single PDF. For example, you
can combine word-processing files with slide presentations, spreadsheets, and web pages. Choose File &amp;gt; Create &amp;gt;
Combine Files Into A Single PDF.
During conversion, Acrobat opens each authoring application, creates a tagged PDF, and assembles these PDFs into a
single tagged PDF.

Last updated 5/10/2016

471
Accessibility, tags, and reflow

The conversion process doesn’t always correctly interpret the document structure for the combined PDF, because the
files being assembled often use different formats. Use Acrobat Pro DC to create an accessible PDF from multiple
documents.
When you combine multiple PDFs into one tagged PDF, it is a good idea to retag the combined document. Combining
tagged and untagged PDFs results in a partially tagged PDF that isn’t accessible to people with disabilities. Some users,
such as those using screen readers, are unaware of the pages that don’t have tags. If you start with a mix of tagged and
untagged PDFs, tag the untagged files before proceeding. If the PDFs are all untagged, add tags to the combined PDF
after you finish inserting, replacing, and deleting pages.
When you insert, replace, or delete pages, Acrobat DC accepts existing tags into the tag tree of the consolidated PDF in
the following manner:

• When you insert pages into a PDF, Acrobat adds the tags (if any) for the new pages to the end of the tag tree. This
order occurs even if you insert the new pages at the beginning or the middle of the document.
• When you replace pages in a PDF, Acrobat adds the tags (if any) from the incoming pages to the end of the tag tree.
This order occurs even if you replace pages at the beginning or the middle of the document. Acrobat retains the tags
(if any) for the replaced pages.
• When you delete pages from a PDF, Acrobat retains the tags (if any) of the deleted pages.
Pages whose tags are out of order in the logical structure tree can cause problems for screen readers. Screen readers read
tags in sequence down the tree, and possibly do not reach the tags for an inserted page until the end of the tree. To fix
this problem, use Acrobat Pro DC to rearrange the tag tree. Place large groups of tags in the same reading order as the
pages themselves. To avoid this step, plan on inserting pages to the end of a PDF, building the document from front to
back in sequence. For example, if you create a title page PDF separately from the content, add the content PDF to the
title page PDF, even though the content document is larger. This approach places the tags for the content after the tags
for the title page. It’s unnecessary to rearrange the tags later in Acrobat Pro.
The tags that remain from a deleted or replaced page don’t connect to any content in the document. Essentially, they
are large pieces of empty tag tree sections. These redundant tags increase the file size of the document, slow down
screen readers, and can cause screen readers to give confusing results. For best results, make tagging the last step in the
conversion process. Use Acrobat Pro DC to delete the tags of deleted pages from the tag tree.
For more information, see Create merged PDFs.

About tools for creating accessible PDF forms
Adobe offers several tools for the creation of accessible PDF forms:
Acrobat Pro DC, Acrobat Standard DC Use one of these applications to open untagged or tagged PDF forms (except

PDF forms that are created from Adobe Designer) to add fillable form fields, such as text boxes, check boxes, and
buttons. Then use the application’s other tools to make the form accessible. Add descriptions to form fields, tag
untagged forms, set the set tab order, manipulate tags, and perform the other PDF accessibility tasks.
Authoring applications Most authoring applications that you can use to design forms don’t retain their fillable form

fields when you convert the files to PDF. Use the forms tools in Acrobat Pro DC to add fillable form fields. Moreover,
if you tag the form during conversion to PDF, the authoring application can generate inappropriate tags for the text
labels of the form fields. In a complex form, for example, the text labels for all the fields can run together into a single
line. Screen readers can’t interpret these fields as individual labels. Such reading order problems can require timeconsuming work in Acrobat Pro DC to split the labels apart. In this case, producing an untagged PDF form from the
authoring application is sometimes the better course. You can then use the Forms tools in Acrobat Pro DC to add
fillable form fields before you tag the entire document. Some forms are straightforward enough that you can produce

a tagged PDF from the authoring application. Then perform light touch-up in Acrobat Pro DC after you add the fillable
form fields.

Workflow for creating accessible PDF forms

alternate text, set the tab order, and tag the forms (if they aren’t already tagged). You can also edit the tags of any tagged
PDF form by using the Touch Up Reading Order tool or the tag tree.
Design the form for accessibility.
Forms tend to have relatively complex layouts compared to documents that have a simple, single-column structure. The
success that an application has in analyzing and tagging a form depends largely on the original formatting and layout
of a document, and the types of fields that it uses.
When you design a form, include headings, instructions, and fields in which users are to enter data. At a minimum,
give each field a label. Also add special instructions for fields that need them. Use graphics tools to draw lines and boxes.
Don’t use characters, such as underscores and vertical bars, because these text characters can confuse screen readers.
Adding descriptions to form fields enables screen readers to identify the fields to users. Users hear the description read
aloud when they tab to the field. Write descriptions that are terse but complete. For example, the description “First
name” is appropriate for a first-name field. Don’t use instructions (such as “Enter first name”) as a description.
Set and test the tab order of a form.
The tab order for form fields enables people with disabilities to use a keyboard to move from field to field in a logical
order. In PDF forms, set the tab order to Use Document Structure. You can test the tab order of a form by using the
following keyboard commands:

• Tab to move focus to the next field
• Shift+Tab to move focus to the previous field
• Spacebar to select options
• Arrow keys to select options or list items
Tag the PDF form and correct tagging issues.
If the PDF form is already tagged, use the Touch Up Reading Order tool in Acrobat to tag each form field. This tool also
enables you to fix any reading order problems of the text labels for the form fields. For example, you may need to split
merged lines of fields into individual fields.

Chapter 13: Searching and indexing

Creating PDF indexes
Create and manage an index in a PDF
You can reduce the time required to search a long PDF by embedding an index of the words in the document. Acrobat
DC can search the index much faster than it can search the document. The embedded index is included in distributed
or shared copies of the PDF. Users search PDFs with embedded indexes exactly as they search those without embedded
indexes; no extra steps are required.

Add an index to a PDF
1 With the document open in Acrobat DC, choose Tools &amp;gt; Index.

The Index toolset is displayed in the secondary toolbar.
2 In the secondary toolbar, click Manage Embedded Index.
3 In the Manage Embedded Index dialog box, click Embed Index.
4 Read the messages that appear, and click OK.

Note: In Outlook and Lotus Notes, you have the option of embedding an index when you convert email messages or
folders to PDF. This is especially recommended for folders containing many email messages.

Update or remove the embedded index in a PDF
1 Choose Tools &amp;gt; Index.

The Index toolset is displayed in the secondary toolbar.
2 In the secondary toolbar, click Manage Embedded Index.
3 Click either Update Index or Remove Index.

About the Catalog feature (Acrobat Pro DC)
You can define a specific group of PDFs as a catalog and create a unified index for that entire collection of documents.
When users search the cataloged PDFs for specific information, the index makes the search process much faster.
When you distribute the collection on a CD, you can include the index with the PDFs.
You can catalog documents written in Roman, Chinese, Japanese, or Korean characters. The items you can catalog
include the document text, comments, bookmarks, form fields, tags, object and document metadata, attachments,
document information, digital signatures, image XIF (extended image file format) metadata, and custom document
properties.

Searching and indexing

Preparing PDFs for indexing (Acrobat Pro DC)
Begin by creating a folder to contain the PDFs you want to index. All PDFs should be complete in both content and
electronic features, such as links, bookmarks, and form fields. If the files to be indexed include scanned documents,
make sure that the text is searchable. Break long documents into smaller, chapter-sized files, to improve search
performance. You can also add information to a file’s document properties to improve the file’s searchability.
Before you index a document collection, it’s essential that you set up the document structure on the disk drive or
network server volume and verify cross-platform filenames. Filenames may be truncated and hard to retrieve in a crossplatform search. To prevent this problem, consider these guidelines:

• Rename files, folders, and indexes using the MS-DOS file-naming convention (eight characters or fewer followed
by a three-character filename extension), particularly if you plan to deliver the document collection and index on
an ISO 9660-formatted CD-ROM disc.
• Remove extended characters, such as accented characters and non-English characters, from file and folder names.
(The font used by the Catalog feature does not support character codes 133 through 159.)
• Don’t use deeply nested folders or path names that exceed 256 characters for indexes that will be searched by Mac
OS users.
• If you use Mac OS with an OS/2 LAN server, configure IBM®LAN Server Macintosh (LSM) to enforce MS-DOS filenaming conventions, or index only FAT (File Allocation Table) volumes. (HPFS [High Performance File System]
volumes may contain long unretrievable filenames.)
If the document structure includes subfolders that you don’t want indexed, you can exclude them during the
indexing process.

Adding metadata to document properties (Acrobat Pro DC)
To make a PDF easier to search, you can add file information, called metadata, to the document properties. (You can
see the properties of the currently open PDF by choosing File &amp;gt; Properties, and clicking the Description tab.)
When adding data for document properties, consider the following recommendations:

• Use a good descriptive title in the Title field. The filename of the document should appear in the Search Results
dialog box.
• Always use the same option (field) for similar information. For example, don’t add an important term to the Subject
option for some documents and to the Keywords option for others.
• Use a single, consistent term for the same information. For example, don’t use biology for some documents and life
sciences for others.
• Use the Author option to identify the group responsible for the document. For example, the author of a hiring policy
document might be the Human Resources department.
• If you use document part numbers, add them as Keywords. For example, adding doc#=m234 in Keywords could
indicate a specific document in a series of several hundred documents on a particular subject.
• Use the Subject or Keywords option, either alone or together, to categorize documents by type. For example, you
might use status report as a Subject entry and monthly or weekly as a Keywords entry for a single document.
If you already have specialized training in Adobe PDF, you can define custom data fields, such as Document Type,
Document Number, and Document Identifier, when you create the index. This is recommended only for advanced
users and is not covered in Acrobat Complete Help.

Searching and indexing

Create an index for a collection (Acrobat Pro DC)
When you build a new index, Acrobat DC creates a file with the .pdx extension and a new support folder, which
contains one or more files with .idx extensions. The IDX files contain the index entries. All of these files must be
available to users who want to search the index.
1 Choose Tools &amp;gt; Index.

The Index toolset is displayed in the secondary toolbar.
2 In the secondary toolbar, click Full Text Index With Catalog.

The Catalog dialog box is displayed.
3 In the Catalog dialog box, click New Index.

The New Index Definition dialog box is displayed.

4 In Index Title, type a name for the index file.
5 In Index Description, type a few words about the type of index or its purpose.
6 Click Options, select any advanced options you want to apply to your index, and click OK.

7 Under Include These Directories, click Add, select a folder containing some or all of the PDF files to be indexed,

and click OK. To add more folders, repeat this step.
Note: Any folder nested under an included folder will also be included in the indexing process. You can add folders from
multiple servers or disk drives, as long as you do not plan to move the index or any items in the document collection.
8 Under Exclude These Subdirectories, click Add, and select any nested folder that contains PDF files you do not

want to be indexed. Click OK and repeat, as needed.
9 Review your selections. To edit the list of folders to be included or excluded, select the folder you want to change

and click Remove.
10 Click Build, and then specify the location for the index file. Click Save, and then:

• Click Close when the indexing finishes.
• Click Stop to cancel the indexing process.
Note: If you stop the indexing process, you cannot resume the same indexing session but you don’t have to redo the work.
The options and folder selections remain intact. You can click Open Index select the partially finished index, and revise
it.
If long path names are truncated in the Include These Directories and Exclude These Subdirectories options, hold
the pointer over each ellipsis (...) until a tool tip appears, displaying the complete path of the included or excluded
folder.

Indexing Options dialog box
Do Not Include Numbers Select this option to exclude all numbers that appear in the document text from the index.
Excluding numbers can significantly reduce the size of an index, making searches faster.
Add IDs To Adobe PDF v1.0 Files Select this option if your collection includes PDFs created before Acrobat 2.0, which
did not automatically add identification numbers. ID numbers are needed when long Mac OS filenames are shortened
as they are translated into MS-DOS filenames. Acrobat 2.0 and later versions automatically add identifiers.
Do Not Warn For Changed Documents When Searching When this option is not selected, a message appears when you

search documents that have changed since the most recent index build.
Custom Properties Use this option to include custom document properties in the index; only custom document
properties that already exist in the PDFs you index are indexed. Type the property, make a selection from the Type

Searching and indexing

menu, and then click Add. These properties appear as a search option in the Search PDF window's additional criteria
pop-up menus when you search the resulting index. For example, if you enter the custom property Document Name
and choose the string property from the Type menu, a user searching the index can then search within the custom
property by selecting Document Name from the Use These Additional Criteria menu.
Note: When you create custom fields in a Microsoft Office application in which the Convert Document Information option
is selected in the PDFMaker application, the fields transfer over to any PDFs you create.
XMP Fields Use this option to include custom XMP fields. The custom XMP fields are indexed and appear in the
additional criteria pop-up menus to be searchable in the selected indexes.
Stop Words Use to exclude specific words (500 maximum) from the index search results. Type the word, click Add, and
repeat as needed. Excluding words can make the index 10% to 15% smaller. A stop word can contain up to 128
characters and is case sensitive.

Note: To prevent users from trying to search phrases that contain these words, list words that aren’t indexed in the Catalog
Read Me file.
Structure Tags Use this option to make specific leaf-element tag nodes searchable in documents that have a tagged

logical structure.
Note: The Custom Properties, Stop Words, and Tags settings apply to the current index only. To apply these settings globally
to any index you create, you can change the default settings for custom fields, stop words, and tags in the Catalog panel of
the Preferences dialog box.

Catalog ReadMe files (Acrobat Pro DC)
It is often a good idea to create a separate ReadMe file and put it in the folder with the index. This ReadMe file can give
people details about your index, such as:

• The kind of documents indexed.
• The search options supported.
• The person to contact or a phone number to call with questions.
• A list of numbers or words that are excluded from the index.
• A list of the folders containing documents included in a LAN-based index, or a list of the documents included in a
disk-based index. You might also include a brief description of the contents of each folder or document.
• A list of the values for each document if you assign Document Info field values.
If a catalog has an especially large number of documents, consider including a table that shows the values assigned
to each document. The table can be part of your ReadMe file or a separate document. While you are developing the
index, you can use the table to maintain consistency.

Revise an index (Acrobat Pro DC)
You can update, rebuild, or purge an existing index.
1 Choose Tools &amp;gt; Index.

The Index toolset is displayed in the secondary toolbar.
2 In the secondary toolbar, click Full Text Index With Catalog.

The Catalog dialog box is displayed.
3 In the Catalog dialog box, click Open Index.

Last updated 5/10/2016

Searching and indexing

4 Locate and select the index definition file (PDX) for the index, and click Open.
5 If the index was created with Acrobat 5.0 or earlier, select Create Copy to create a new index (without overwriting

the earlier version), or select Overwrite Old Index to overwrite the earlier index.
6 In the Index Definition dialog box, make any changes you want, and then click the function you want Acrobat DC

to perform:
Build Creates a new IDX file with the existing information, and updates it by adding new entries and marking
changed or outdated entries as invalid. If you make a large number of changes, or use this option repeatedly instead
of creating a new index, search times may increase.
Rebuild Creates a new index, overwriting the existing index folder and its contents (the IDX files).
Purge Deletes the index contents (the IDX files) without deleting the index file itself (PDX).

Catalog preferences (Acrobat Pro DC)
You can set preferences for indexing that apply globally to all subsequent indexes you build. You can override some of
these preferences for an individual index by selecting new options during the index-building process.
In the Preferences dialog box under Categories, select Catalog. Many of the options are identical to those described
for the index-building process.
The Force ISO 9660 Compatibility On Folders option is useful when you don’t want to change long PDF filenames to
MS-DOS filenames as you prepare documents for indexing. However, you must still use MS-DOS file-naming
conventions for the folder names (8 characters or fewer) even though this isn’t necessary for the filenames.

Scheduled index updates (Acrobat Pro DC)
Use the Catalog feature and a catalog batch PDX file (.bpdx) to schedule when and how often to automatically build,
rebuild, update, and purge an index. A BPDX file is a text file that contains a list of platform-dependent catalog index
file paths and flags. You use a scheduling application, such as Windows Scheduler, to display the BPDX file in Acrobat
DC. Acrobat DC then re-creates the index according to the flags in the BPDX file.
For more information on scheduling an indexing update, search for BPDX at www.adobe.com/support.
Note: To use BPDX files, in the Preferences dialog box under Catalog, select Allow Catalog Batch Files (.bpdx) To Be Run.

Moving collections and their indexes (Acrobat Pro DC)
You can develop and test an indexed document collection on a local hard drive and then move the finished document
collection to a network server or disk. An index definition contains relative paths between the index definition file
(PDX) and the folders containing the indexed documents. If these relative paths are unchanged, you don’t have to
rebuild the index after moving the indexed document collection. If the PDX file and the folders containing the indexed
documents are in the same folder, you can maintain the relative path simply by moving that folder.
If the relative path changes, you must create a new index after you move the indexed document collection. However,
you can still use the original PDX file. To use the original PDX file, first move the indexed documents. Then copy the
PDX file to the folder where you want to create the new index, and edit the include and exclude lists of directories and
subdirectories, as necessary.
If the index resides on a drive or server volume separate from any part of the collection it applies to, moving either the
collection or the index breaks the index. If you intend to move a document collection either to another network location
or onto a CD, create and build the index in the same location as the collection.

Searching PDFs
You have lots of control and lots of possibilities for running effective and efficient searches in Adobe Acrobat DC. A
search can be broad or narrow, including many different kinds of data and covering multiple Adobe PDFs.
If you work with large numbers of related PDFs, you can define them as a catalog in Acrobat Pro DC, which generates
a PDF index for the PDFs. Searching the PDF index—instead of the PDFs themselves—dramatically speeds up
searches. See Creating PDF indexes.

Search and replace features overview
You run searches to find specific items in PDFs. You can run a simple search, looking for a search term within in a single
file, or you can run a more complex search, looking for various kinds of data in one or more PDFs. You can selectively
replace text.
You can run a search using either the Search window or the Find toolbar. In either case, Acrobat searches the PDF body
text, layers, form fields, and digital signatures. You can also include bookmarks and comments in the search. Only the
Find toolbar includes a Replace With option.

The Search window offers more options and more kinds of searches than the Find toolbar. When you use the Search
window, object data and image XIF (extended image file format) metadata are also searched. For searches across
multiple PDFs, Acrobat also looks at document properties and XMP metadata, and it searches indexed structure tags
when searching a PDF index. If some of the PDFs you search have attached PDFs, you can include the attachments in
the search.
Note: PDFs can have multiple layers. If the search results include an occurrence on a hidden layer, selecting that occurrence
displays an alert that asks if you want to make that layer visible.

Access the search features
Where you start your search depends on the type of search you want to run. Use the Find toolbar for a quick search of
the current PDF and to replace text. Use the Search window to look for words or document properties across multiple
PDFs, use advanced search options, and search PDF indexes.

Display the Find toolbar
Open it by choosing Edit &amp;gt; Find (Ctrl/Command+F).

Arrange the PDF document window and Search window
In the Search window, click Arrange Windows

.

Acrobat resizes and arranges the two windows side by side so that together they almost fill the entire screen.
Note: Clicking the Arrange Windows button a second time resizes the document window but leaves the Search
window unchanged. If you want to make the Search window larger or smaller, drag the corner or edge, as you would
to resize any window on your operating system.

Find and replace text in PDFs

Find and replace text in a PDF
The Find toolbar searches the currently open PDF. You can selectively replace the search term with alternative text. You
replace text one instance at a time. You cannot make a global change throughout a PDF or across multiple PDFs.
Choose Edit &amp;gt; Find (Ctrl/Command+F).
1 Type the text you want to search for in the text box on the Find toolbar.
2 To replace text, click Replace With to expand the toolbar, then type the replacement text in the Replace With text

box.
3 (Optional) Click the arrow

next to the text box and choose one or more of the following:

Whole Words Only Finds only occurrences of the complete word you type in the text box. For example, if you search
for the word stick, the words tick and sticky aren’t found.
Case-Sensitive Finds only occurrences of the words that match the capitalization you type. For example, if you

search for the word Web, the words web and WEB aren’t found.
Include Bookmarks Also searches the text in the Bookmarks panel.
Include Comments Also searches the text of any comments.

4 Click Next.

Acrobat jumps to the first instance of the search term, which appears highlighted.

5 Click Replace to change the highlighted text, or click Next to go to the next instance of the search term. Alternatively,

click Previous to go back to the previous instance of the search term.

Find text in multiple PDFs
The Search window enables you to look for search terms in multiple PDFs. For example, you can search across all PDFs
in a specific location or all files in an open PDF Portfolio. The Replace With option is not availble in the Search window.
Note: If documents are encrypted (have security applied to them), you cannot search them as part of a multiple-document
search. Open those documents first and search them one at a time. However, documents encrypted as Adobe Digital
Editions are an exception and can be searched as part of a multiple-document search.
1 Open Acrobat DC on your desktop (not in a web browser).
2 Do one of the following.

• In the Find toolbar, type the search text, and then choose Open Full Acrobat Search from the pop-up menu.
• In the Search window, type the search text.
3 In the Search window, select All PDF Documents In. From the pop-up menu directly below this option, choose

Browse For Location.
4 Select the location, either on your computer or on a network, and click OK.
5 To specify additional search criteria, click Show Advanced Options, and specify the options.
6 Click Search.

During a search, you can click a result or use keyboard shortcuts to navigate the results without interrupting the
search. Clicking the Stop button under the search-progress bar cancels further searching and limits the results to the
occurrences already found. It doesn’t close the Search window or delete the Results list. To see more results, run a new
search.

Use These Additional Criteria (text options) Includes the basic search options plus five additional options:
Proximity Searches for two or more words that are separated by no more than a specified number of words, as set in

the Search preferences. Available only for a search of multiple documents or index definition files, and when Match All
Of The Words is selected.
Stemming Finds words that contain part (the stem) of the specified search word. For example, a search for opening

finds instances of open, opened, opens, and openly. This option applies to single words and phrases when you search the
current PDF, a folder, or an index created with Acrobat 6.0 or later. Wildcard characters (*, ?) aren’t permitted in
stemming searches. Stemming isn’t available if either Whole Words Only or Case-Sensitive is selected.
Include Bookmarks Searches the text of any bookmarks, as viewed in the Bookmarks panel.
Include Comments Searches the text of any comments added to the PDF, as viewed in the Comments panel.
Include Attachments Searches files that are attached to the current PDF or other attached PDFs (up to two levels deep).
Use These Additional Criteria (document properties) Appears only for searches across multiple PDFs or PDF indexes.

You can select multiple property-modifier-value combinations and apply them to searches. This setting does not apply
to non-PDF files inside PDF Portfolios.
Note: You can search by document properties alone by using document property options in combination with a search
for specific text.

Check box Applies the criteria set in the three connected options to the search. (The check box is selected automatically
when you enter information in any of the three options for that set. After you enter options, deselecting the check box
doesn’t clear the entries; they just aren’t applied to the search.)
First menu (property) Indicates the document characteristic to search for. The available options include Date Created,

Date Modified, Author, Title, Subject, Filename, Keywords, Bookmarks, Comments, JPEG Images, XMP Metadata, and
Object Data.
Second menu (modifier) Indicates the level of matching. If the first menu selection is a date, the available options in the
second menu are Is Exactly, Is Before, Is After, Is Not. Otherwise, the available options are Contains and Does Not
Contain.
Third box (value or text) Indicates the information to be matched, which you type in. If the first menu selection is a
date, you can click the arrow to open a calendar that you can navigate to find and select the date you want.

Boolean operators
Commonly used Boolean operators include the following:
AND
Use between two words to find documents that contain both terms, in any order. For example, type paris AND france
to identify documents that contain both paris and france. Searches with AND and no other Boolean operators produce
the same results as selecting the All Of The Words option.

NOT
Use before a search term to exclude any documents that contain that term. For example, type NOT kentucky to find all
documents that don’t contain the word kentucky. Or, type paris NOT kentucky to find all documents that contain the
word paris but not the word kentucky.

Searching and indexing

OR
Use to search for all instances of either term. For example, type email OR e-mail to find all documents with occurrences
of either spelling. Searches with OR and no other Boolean operators produce the same results as selecting the Any Of
The Words option.

^ (exclusive OR)
Use to search for all instances that have either term but not both. For example, type cat ^ dog to find all documents with
occurrences of either cat or dog but not both cat and dog.

()
Use parentheses to specify the order of evaluation of terms. For example, type white AND (whale OR ahab) to find all
documents that contain either white and whale or white and ahab. (The query processor performs an OR query on
whale and ahab and then performs an AND query on those results with white.)

To learn more about Boolean queries, syntax, and other Boolean operators that you can use in your searches, refer to
any standard text, website, or other resource with complete Boolean information.

Search index files of cataloged PDFs
A full-text index is created when someone uses Acrobat to define a catalog of PDFs. You can search that index rather
than running a full-text search of each individual PDF in the catalog. An index search produces a results list with links
to the occurrences of the indexed documents.
Note: To search a PDF index, you must open Acrobat as a stand-alone application, not within your web browser.
In Mac OS, indexes created with some older versions of Acrobat are not compatible with the Acrobat X Search feature.
If you have upgraded recently, update the index before using Acrobat X to search.
Choose Edit &amp;gt; Advanced Search.
1 Type the search text, and then click Show More Options, near the bottom of the Search window.
2 For Look In, choose Select Index.
3 Select an index from the list, or click Add and add an index. Repeat as needed.

Note: To read file data about a selected index, click Info. To exclude an index from the search, select it and click Remove.
4 Click OK to close the Index Selection dialog box, and then choose Currently Selected Indexes from the Look In

menu.
5 Proceed with your search as usual.

Note: Selecting the Match Whole Word Only option when searching indexes significantly reduces the time taken to
return results. See Creating PDF indexes.

Chapter 14: Multimedia and 3D models

Add audio, video, and interactive objects to PDFs
Include audio, video, and interactive 3D objects in your PDF files. Add files directly to your PDF or link to files on the
web.
This document provides instructions for Acrobat DC. If you're using Acrobat Reader DC, see What can I do with Adobe
Reader. If you're using Acrobat XI, see Acrobat XI Help .

Multimedia and PDFs (Acrobat Pro DC)
Adding video, sound, and interactive content transforms PDFs into multidimensional communication tools that
increase interest and engagement in your documents.
Acrobat Pro automatically converts video to FLV files. This format ensures both high-quality viewing and compatibility
across computer platforms. FLV files are also compact, so converting multimedia to this format is helps reduce the size
of multimedia PDFs.
<!-- 5b9cfb64-aa51-4c87-a4ac-00f2005adf69 <=< ACCEPT -->
All multimedia that are H.264 compliant can be played back in Adobe Reader 9 and later. (H.264, also known as MPEG4 part 10, is a video compression standard that provides high-quality video without substantially increasing file size.)
Video files of varying formats and filename extensions can be H.264 compliant.
Media files in other formats can be played back in earlier versions of Adobe Reader. However, users must install the
appropriate application (such as QuickTime or Windows Media Player) to play the multimedia.
Another way to add multimedia is by entering a URL that refers to a video file or streaming media. Three types of URLs
can be used: RTMP, HTTP, and HTTPS. On HTTP and HTTPS servers, H.264-compliant MOV and MP4 files are
supported.
Interactive content developed in Flash and produced as SWF files (.swf) can be added to PDFs to provide
complimentary tools for text. Examples of applications developed in Flash include an RSS Reader, calculator, and
online maps.

Add multimedia files to a PDF
Acrobat Pro DC supports mp3, mov, SWF files, and other files encoded in H.264 (with AAC audio). You can convert
other file types into one of the supported formats by using Adobe Media Encoder. You can also add mp3 audio files to
a PDF for playback on any platform.
Note: FLV and F4V files are no longer supported in both Acrobat DC and PDFMaker. You cannot embed FLV and F4V
files using either Acrobat DC or PDFMaker. However, if a document has already FLV or F4V files embedded (for example,
a PowerPoint presentation or a Word file), it will still be converted to PDFs.
For a list of supported multimedia file formats, see this TechNote.

3D properties (Acrobat Pro DC)
View 3D properties by using the Select Object Tool (Tools &amp;gt; Rich Media &amp;gt; Select Object) to double-click within an
activated model.

3D tab
The options on the 3D tab determine how the 3D model is presented. Unlike the settings on the other tabs, 3D settings
do not affect the imported file itself.
The options on the 3D tab are the same as the options on the 3D toolbar except for the following:
Animation Style For models created with animation, this setting determines how the animation runs in Acrobat.
Add Default Views Allows you to use different model views. An orthographic projection (ortho) effectively removes a
dimension, preserving the size ratio between objects but giving the 3D model a less realistic appearance. Orthographic
projection is especially useful for viewing certain diagrams, such as 3D mathematical functions plotted on a graph. A
perspective projection offers a more realistic scene in which objects in the distance appear smaller than objects of the
same size in the foreground.
Show Toolbar Displays the 3D toolbar along with the image. When this option is not selected, you can right-click the

3D image to view the 3D toolbar.
Open model tree Displays the model tree on the Model Tree pane. The Model Tree has three panes. Each pane displays
a specific type of information or controls.
Script Specifies the JavaScript file that runs if a 3D model is enabled. Click Browse to add a JavaScript file to the PDF.

Launch Settings
Enable When Specifies when the 3D model is activated. When the 3D model is enabled, you can interact with it by

using the 3D navigation tools, for example.
Disable When Determines how the 3D model can be deactivated. When a 3D model is disabled, the 2D preview image

or poster appears in the canvas.
Playback Style Enables you to display the 3D model in a floating window outside the page. If you select Play Content
In Floating Window, you can select the size of the window (in pixels) from the Height and Width menus.
Border Width Select to create a border around the 3D object.
Transparent Background Removes any background color.
Poster Image To replace the default view of the 3D model when it isn’t activated, select a poster image option. Click

Browse to find the image you want.

Resources
Use the Resources tab to add files developed in Flash® to a 3D model for animation, effects, and textures. To bind a Flash
resource, select it from the list of resources, and then select a binding type (Foreground, Background, or Material). To
bind a material, also enter the material name for the part or parts where you want to display the material.
Add Use to add SWF files for animations and backgrounds for the 3D model.
Add Directory Select to add a directory of resource files to the 3D object.
Remove Select a file in the list, and then click Remove to delete it from the file.
Name Displays the name of the file that is selected from the list. You can also rename a resource, which is useful with

scripting. For example, you can replace the name with the one used in a script.
Binding When adding files that are developed in Flash as a resource for a 3D model, binding determines how those

files interact. For example, you can identify a resource to run in the background and one to run in the foreground. After
you add the files to the file list, select one, and in the Binding section, select either Background, Foreground, or
Material.
Material 3D designers can use the Material field to define a material to use in a model. The material name can be

associated with a resource by selecting Material in the Binding section.
FlashVars Flash developers can use the FlashVars field to add ActionScript™ variables for the selected file.

3D toolbar overview
The 3D toolbar appears after you click the 3D model with the Hand tool. This action activates the 3D model and plays
animations that are set to play when the file is enabled. The 3D toolbar always appears in the area above the upper-left
corner of the 3D model and cannot be moved. A small arrow appears to the right of the Rotate tool, which you can click
to either hide or expand the toolbar.
You can use the 3D toolbar to zoom in and out, rotate, and pan across the object. Use the Model Tree to hide or isolate
parts, or make parts transparent.
You manipulate a 3D model by selecting and dragging various 3D navigation tools. When you navigate in 3D, it helps
to think of it as viewing the stationary 3D model from a camera’s perspective. You can rotate, pan (move up, down, or
side-to-side), and zoom in or out.

3D navigation tools
Rotate

Turns 3D objects around relative to the screen. How the objects move depends on the starting view, where you start
dragging, and the direction in which you drag.
Note: You can also use the Hand tool to rotate an object. Ensure that Enable 3D Selection For The Hand Tool is selected in
the 3D panel of the Preferences dialog box.
Spin

Turns a 3D model in parallel to two fixed axes in the 3D model, the x-axis and the z-axis.
Pan

Moves the model vertically and horizontally only. You can also pan with the Hand tool: Ctrl-drag.
Zoom

Moves you toward, or away from, objects in the scene when you drag vertically. You can also zoom with the Hand tool
by holding down Shift as you drag.
Walk

Pivots horizontally around the scene when you drag horizontally. Moves forward or backward in the scene when you
drag vertically; maintains a constant elevation level, regardless of how you drag. The Walk tool is especially useful for
architectural 3D models. To change the walking speed, change the default display units in the Preferences (3D).
Note: The Walk tool is available when you select the Preferences setting that consolidates tools or when you right-click the
3D model and choose Tools &amp;gt; Walk.
Fly

Navigates through a model while maintaining the surface orientation. Right-click and drag inside the 3D window. The
Fly tool moves more slowly the closer you move toward an object. Drag the pointer right or left to turn.
To rotate the camera view, click the left mouse button inside the 3D window and drag to turn the camera view. To return
to the starting camera direction, move the mouse back to the initial click point.

Last updated 5/10/2016

494
Multimedia and 3D models

Use the mouse scroll wheel to move rapidly backward and forward along the camera view direction. This functionality
is useful if you get lost within a model or fly into the surface.
Camera properties

Defines the camera angle, alignment, and other properties that define the lens through which a 3D model is viewed.
Camera properties are components of views but are set independently.
3D Measurement Tool

Measures part sizes and distances in the 3D model.

3D toolbar view controls
Default View

Returns to a preset zoom, pan, rotation, and projection mode of the 3D model. Use the Options menu in the View pane
of the Model Tree to set a different view as the default. Or use the Manage Views command on the 3D toolbar Views
menu to set a different view as the default.
If an object ever moves out of your view, you have, in essence, turned your camera away from the object. Click the
Default View icon on the 3D toolbar to move the object back into view.
Views menu Lists any views defined for the current 3D model.
Toggle Model Tree

Opens and hides the Model Tree.
Play/Pause Animation

Plays or pauses any JavaScript-enabled animation. The Play/Pause Animation pop-up menu opens a slider that you can
drag back and forth to move to different times in the animation sequence.
Use Orthographic/Perspective Projection

Toggles between displaying perspective and orthographic projection of the 3D object.
Model Render Mode menu

Determines how the 3D shape appears. For an illustrated guide, see Examples of model rendering modes .
Enable Extra Lighting menu

Lists the different lighting effects that are available to enhance the illumination of the 3D object. Experiment to get the
visual effects you want.
Background Color

Opens the color picker, which you can use to select a different color for the space surrounding the 3D object.
Toggle Cross Section

Shows and hides cross sections of the object. Click the pop-up menu to open the Cross Section Properties dialog box.
For more information, see Create cross sections .
Add Multimedia/3D Comment

3D preferences
In the 3D &amp; Multimedia panel of the Preferences dialog box, you can determine whether the 3D toolbar and Model
Tree are displayed by default. You can also specify a default renderer and determine whether animations are allowed.
Enable Playing of 3D Content The dynamic nature of 3D provides the potential for it to be subject to security

vulnerabilities. Therefore, the auto-play of 3D content in PDFs is disabled by default. Select this option to enable 3D
content in PDFs.
Preferred Renderer Specifies the rendering engine used to affect both performance and quality, so it’s important to

select the appropriate renderer. Depending on your system, you can change your render engine. If you select a DirectX®
or OpenGL option, all rendering takes place using the graphics chip on the video adapter. If Software is selected,
rendering takes more time, but the performance is often more consistent with the model rendering of the originating
application.
Enable Hardware Rendering For Legacy Video Cards Forces the use of a hardware accelerator for even video adapters

that do not support a pixel shader.
Enable Double-Sided Rendering Some model parts have two sides. To save time and space, you can deselect this option

to render only the side facing the user. If the user looks inside a part rendered with only one side, the back side would
be invisible.
Preferred 3D PMI Rendering Mode Specifies the PMI mode to use for rendering. You can select one of the following

options:
Use Content Setting—The rendering of the PMI uses the setting of each PMI to decide whether it uses the Z-buffer.
Always Render 3D PMI In Front Of Model—The rendering of the PMI ignores the Z-buffer regardless of the setting in
the file.
Always Render 3D PMI Using Z-buffer—The rendering of the PMI always turns on Z-buffer regardless of the setting
in the file.
Open Model Tree On 3D Activation Determines whether the Model Tree is displayed when the 3D model is activated.
Choose Use Annotation’s Setting to use whichever setting the author used when adding the 3D model to the PDF.
Default Toolbar State Determines whether the 3D toolbar is shown or hidden when a 3D model is activated. Choose
Use Annotation’s Setting to use whichever setting the author used when adding the 3D model to the PDF.
Enable Selection For The Hand Tool Lets the user select and highlight parts of the 3D model using the Hand tool. If this
option is not selected, use the Object Data tool (Tools &amp;gt; Interactive Objects &amp;gt; Select Object) to select the object.
Consolidate Tools On The 3D Toolbar Selecting this option places the manipulation and navigation tools under the

Rotate tool, thereby shortening the 3D toolbar.
Enable View Transitions Some 3D models include animated transitions between views. Deselect this option if you want

to prevent this 3D animation.
Show 3D Orientation Axis Turns on or off an in-scene display of an axis that indicates the current orientation of the 3D

scene.
Optimization Scheme For Low Framerate Specifies what happens to animations of complex models when the framerate

becomes low. None does not compromise the visuals and leaves the framerate low. Bounding Box shows the threedimensional planes enclosing the parts instead of the parts themselves, which keeps the framerate high. Drop Objects
does not show some parts of the model, which keeps the framerate high.
Framerate Threshold Sets the minimum framerate, either by dragging the slider or entering a number in the value box.
If the framerate drops below that number of frames per second, the Optimization Scheme For Low Framerate option
goes into effect.

Measuring 3D objects in PDFs
Use the 3D Measurement Tool to measure 3D models. You can create measurements between combinations of points
or edges of the 3D model. As you move the pointer over the 3D model, specific points and edges are highlighted. The
3D Measurement Tool supports four types of measurements: perpendicular distance between two straight edges, linear
distance between two points, the radius of circular edges, and the angle between two edges (or three points).
You can associate 3D measurements with specific views. If the default view is active when a measurement is added, a
new measurement view is created. This view is added to the view hierarchy in the Model Tree. The measurement is
associated with that view only. The measurement shows up as a child of the view.
You can also display comments while taking measurements. These comments (also called measurement markups) are
preserved after the document is closed.

Measure 3D objects
1 Click a 3D model in a PDF to enable it.
2 Click the 3D Measurement Tool icon

on the 3D toolbar. (If the 3D toolbar view is set for consolidated tools,
select the 3D Measurement tool from the pop-up menu next to the Navigation tool.)

Setting 3D views in PDFs
The default view of a 3D model lets you quickly revert to a starting point at any time as you interact with the model. A
default view is different from a preview, which determines what the 3D model looks like when it’s not activated. The
list of all available views for the 3D model appears in the Views menu on the 3D toolbar and in the View pane of the
Model Tree.
You can also create additional views of the 3D model in Acrobat that let you quickly navigate the 3D content as you
want (such as top, bottom, left, right, inside, outside, exploded, or assembled). A view can include lighting, camera
position, rendering mode, the Model Tree state, and transparency and cross section settings. Custom views can include
precise camera properties.
You can link views to bookmarks in the Bookmarks panel, or you can use the Go To 3D View action to link views to
buttons and links that you create on the page.

Default view
When you create a PDF from a 3D model or add a 3D file to an existing PDF, Acrobat creates an initial default view.
The default view is generated independently of whether additional default views are created or views exist in the 3D file.
The characteristics of the default view generated are as follows:

•

A perspective projection is used.

• The viewpoint is placed away from the object such that all visible nodes fill most of the field view.
• The direction and orientation of the offset is mainly along the negative X-axis, with a relatively small offset along
the negative Y-axis, and a smaller positive Z-axis offset.
• The camera points at the center of the visible nodes, oriented such that the Z-axis is vertical and upwards direction
is positive in the displayed annotation.
Set the background color, render mode and lighting for the default view by checking the Show Advanced Options box
in the Insert 3D dialog, selecting the 3D tab and adjusting the parameters shown.

Create a custom view
1 With the Hand tool, click the 3D model to enable it.
2 Use the Rotate, Pan, and Zoom tools in the 3D toolbar to change the view.

Adding multimedia to PDFs
Include audio, video, and interactive 3D objects in your PDF files. Add files directly to your PDF or link to files on the
web.
This document provides instructions for Acrobat DC. If you're using Acrobat Reader DC, see What can I do with Adobe
Reader. If you're using Acrobat XI, see Acrobat XI Help .

Multimedia and PDFs (Acrobat Pro DC)
Adding video, sound, and interactive content transforms PDFs into multidimensional communication tools that
increase interest and engagement in your documents.
<!-- 5b9cfb64-aa51-4c87-a4ac-00f2005adf69 <=< ACCEPT -->
All multimedia that are H.264 compliant can be played back in Adobe Reader 9 and later. (H.264, also known as MPEG4 part 10, is a video compression standard that provides high-quality video without substantially increasing file size.)
Video files of varying formats and filename extensions can be H.264 compliant.
Media files in other formats can be played back in earlier versions of Adobe Reader. However, users must install the
appropriate application (such as QuickTime or Windows Media Player) to play the multimedia.
Another way to add multimedia is by entering a URL that refers to a video file or streaming media. Three types of URLs
can be used: RTMP, HTTP, and HTTPS. On HTTP and HTTPS servers, H.264-compliant MOV and MP4 files are
supported.
Interactive content developed in Flash and produced as SWF files (.swf) can be added to PDFs to provide
complimentary tools for text. Examples of applications developed in Flash include an RSS Reader, calculator, and
online maps.

Add multimedia files to a PDF
Acrobat Pro DC supports mp3, mov, SWF files, and other files encoded in H.264 (with AAC audio). You can convert
other file types into one of the supported formats by using Adobe Media Encoder. You can also add mp3 audio files to
a PDF for playback on any platform.
Note: FLV and F4V files are no longer supported in both Acrobat DC and PDFMaker. You cannot embed FLV and F4V
files using either Acrobat DC or PDFMaker. However, if a document has already FLV or F4V files embedded (for example,
a PowerPoint presentation or a Word file), it will still be converted to PDFs.

Commenting on 3D designs in PDFs
Comments added to a 3D object are associated with specific views that are defined when the comments are added. If
the view is changed—for example, if the 3D object is rotated or moved—the comments are no longer visible.
You have three ways to add comments to a 3D object:

• Using the 3D Comment Tool on the 3D toolbar to add comments to specific parts of a 3D model.
• Using the annotation tools available in the secondary toolbar of the Comment tool to add a variety of comment
types to a 3D view.
• Converting a 3D measurement into a comment.
Note: Adding comments to 3D model views requires version 7.0.7 or later of Acrobat or Reader.

If you don’t want a comment to be associated with a 3D view, add the comment outside the 3D object area.

Add a 3D Comment to an object
Comments created by using the 3D Comment Tool are like measurements in that they are associated with a specific
part of the 3D geometry. When you add 3D comments to the default view of a model, a new view, called
3DCommentView is created. 3D comments added to other views are listed as components of that view in the Model
Tree. You can edit and remove 3D comments the same way to edit and remove measurements.
1 Click the Add 3D Comment tool on the 3D toolbar.

Note: The 3D toolbar appears when you hover the cursor over the 3D model. If the Add 3D Comment tool is not visible
in the toolbar, then right-click the 3D model and choose Tools &amp;gt; Add 3D Comments. You can also expand the default
3D toolbar by right clicking the 3D model and choosing Tools &amp;gt; Expand 3D Tools.
2 Select a part of the model you want to add a 3D comment to.
3 In the Enter Comment String dialog box, type your comment.

Add comments from the Comment toolset
When you add comments by using the tools on the Comment toolset, a new view is created in the Model Tree called
CommentView.
Note: Adobe Reader DC users can add comments to a PDF if the document author enables commenting for that PDF.
1 Choose Tools &amp;gt; Comment.

The Comment toolset is displayed in the secondary toolbar.
2 In the secondary toolbar, select a commenting tool, and then click inside the 3D object area.
3 Click inside the 3D object area to create a comment. A new view definition is also created in the Model Tree with a

default name such as “CommentView1.”
4 To add more comments, do one of the following:

• To create an additional comment in a view, make sure that the commenting view you want is selected in the
Model Tree. Then click inside the 3D object area.
• To create an additional comment in a new commenting view, make sure that no commenting view is selected in
the Model Tree. Then click inside the 3D object area.
Note: If you delete one of these automatically generated commenting views, the associated comments are still available. You
can view and select them in the Comments panel or in the Model Tree, where they are listed under the views. Selecting a
comment switches the 3D model to the same viewing configuration it had when the comment was added.

Convert 3D measurements to comments
Individual measurements can be converted to comments, so that they can be reviewed and annotated like other types
of comments.
1 In the View pane of the Model Tree, right-click the plus sign next to the measurement view to display the list of

individual measurements.
Note: The measurement view is available only when you have added measurements by using the 3D Measurement Tool

Play multimedia in PDFs
Using the Hand tool or the Select tool, click the play area of the video or sound file. When the pointer is positioned over
the play area, it changes to the play mode icon
.

Supported video, audio, and interactive formats
You can play the following types of multimedia in PDFs created using Adobe Acrobat DC or Adobe Acrobat Reader
DC or earlier:
Interactive multimedia Includes SWF files.
Video Includes MOV, M4V, 3GP, and 3G2 video files that use H.264 compression. It also includes FLV, F4V, MP3, and
MP4 files. You must have H.264 codecs installed on your computer to play files that use H.264 compression.
Audio Includes audio files, such as MP3 and MP4

You can play these files on a page or activate them from a link, bookmark, form field, or page action. Each multimedia
file includes a play area from which the media can be activated. The play area typically appears on the PDF page as an
image or a rectangle, but can also be invisible.
Acrobat and Reader also let you play legacy multimedia files created using an earlier version of Acrobat. These include
QuickTime, MPEG, ASF, RAM, and Windows® Media files. However, Acrobat and Reader X do not provide a way to
create legacy multimedia files.
To help protect your computer from viruses, Acrobat asks you if you want to play multimedia files from unverified
sources. You can change this default behavior in the Multimedia Trust preferences.
Using the Hand tool or the Select tool, click the play area of the video or sound file. When the pointer is positioned
over the play area, it changes to the play mode icon
.

Multimedia preferences (legacy)
Two types of PDF files require you to set multimedia preferences:

• PDF files created in Acrobat 8 and earlier.
• PDF files containing multimedia content that needs a plug-in or external player to play, rather than the built-in
media player.
These files require you to identify an additional media player with which to run the multimedia.

Chapter 15: Print production tools
(Acrobat Pro DC)

Print production tools overview (Acrobat Pro DC)
Adobe Acrobat DC adds sophisticated print production tools that enable a complete PDF workflow for high-end color
output. The print production tools can be accessed by choosing Tools &amp;gt; Print Production.

Open the Print Production tools
Choose Tools &amp;gt; Print Production.
The Print Production tools are displayed in the right hand pane.

Print Production tools
Output Preview Combines separation preview, soft proofing, color warnings, and more in one convenient dialog box.
Preflight Allows you to perform more than 400 predefined checks for all the common output errors, and then correct

all fixable errors.

Print production tools (Acrobat Pro DC)

Edit Object Allows you to select, move, and edit both raster and vector objects. You can edit individual object

properties, such as tags, color space, or rendering intent.
Convert Colors Allows you to convert any color space in the document to the target color space.
Flattener Preview Allows you to define and apply flattening settings for transparent objects. Includes a preview for
viewing transparent objects and the effects your settings have on those objects. You can save the settings as presets to
apply to other pages or PDFs.
Save As PDF/X Allows you to save the current document as per the PDF/X standards.
Set Page Boxes Allows you to define the crop, trim, bleed, art, and media boxes on a page. The elements are important
for proper page positioning and placement of printer marks, especially for imposition.
Add Printer Marks Adds standard printer marks to a PDF page for positioning. These marks are embedded in the PDF.
Fix Hairlines Based on user settings, finds hairlines and replaces them with heavier-weight lines.
Ink Manager Modifies the way inks are treated while the current PDF is open. The Acrobat Ink Manager uses the same
options and controls as other Adobe applications.
Trap Presets Allows you to create and apply trap settings for later execution by an Adobe RIP that licenses Adobe InRIP Trapping.
Add Article Box Allows you to define a series of article boxes.

Printer marks and hairlines (Acrobat Pro DC)
About printer marks in PDFs
When you prepare a document for print production, a number of marks are needed to help the print service provider
align separation films for producing proofs, measure film for correct calibration and ink density, trim film to size, and
so on. Printer marks indicate the boundaries of document boxes supported by Adobe PDF, such as trim boxes and bleed
boxes.
You can add printer marks temporarily at print time using the Marks And Bleeds panel of the Advanced Print Setup
dialog box, or you can embed printer marks in the file (and optionally in a layer) using the Add Printer Marks dialog
box. For information about adding printer marks to just the printed output, see Include marks and bleeds (Acrobat Pro
DC).
Note: A PDF created from Adobe InDesign CS and later can include printer marks, either in a separate layer or on the page.
You can view these marks using the Layers tab in Acrobat. If the printer marks were exported as a layer, any printer marks
you create using the Acrobat Add Printer Marks feature replace the InDesign printer marks. If the printer marks are not in
a layer, Acrobat printer marks overlay InDesign printer marks and might not align.

Embed printer marks in a PDF
1 Choose Tools &amp;gt; Print Production &amp;gt; Add Printer Marks.
2 Specify the pages to mark.
3 Specify the marks and settings.

Print production tools (Acrobat Pro DC)

Set Page Boxes dialog box overview
Use the Set Page Boxes dialog box (formerly called Crop Pages) to define boundaries for trim, bleed, and art when
preparing your PDF for printing and other output. You can adjust the margins of document boxes supported by Adobe
PDF, including the media (page size), trim, bleed, and art boxes. This capability is useful if the printer marks you add
using the Add Printer Marks tool (not the Marks And Bleeds panel of the Advanced Print Setup dialog box) would be
clipped because the crop box is too small to accommodate the marks. Print service providers can also use this tool to
expand the page size for imposition tasks.
You can switch between boxes without losing the margins you set for each. As you adjust individual boxes, the preview
in the Set Page Boxes dialog box is redrawn to reflect the new settings. For example, if you expand the crop or media
box, the page content “shrinks” in the preview.
Note: When the crop box is expanded, the media box adjusts accordingly.

Open the Set Page Boxes dialog box
Choose Tools &amp;gt; Print Production &amp;gt; Set Page Boxes.

Fix hairlines
Very thin lines, called hairlines, are problematic in offset printing. If left as is in PDFs, they might not appear in the final
printed piece. The Fix Hairlines tool can find most hairlines and replace them with a heavier-weight line.
1 Choose Tools &amp;gt; Print Production &amp;gt; Fix Hairlines.
2 Enter a width for the hairline you want to find, and enter a replacement width.

3 Select the unit of measurement from the Units menu.
4 (Optional) Select Include Type3 Fonts or Include Patterns to replace hairlines in Type 3 characters or patterns with

the same replacement width as other hairlines.
Font characters and patterns can be used in a variety of contexts in the same document (for example, different
magnification values), so changing the line width may produce unexpected results. Check the results if you select
these options, and adjust your selections as necessary.
5 Specify the pages to check.

Previewing output (Acrobat Pro DC)
Output Preview dialog box overview
The Output Preview dialog box provides the tools and controls to help you simulate how your PDF looks in different
conditions. The top part of the dialog box has several controls for previewing your document. The Preview menu allows
you to switch between previewing separations and previewing color warnings. When you select Separations, the
bottom half of the dialog box lists information about the inks in the file, as well as total area coverage controls. When
you select Color Warnings, a warnings section replaces the separations section and provides information about ink
warning controls. The preview settings you specify in the Output Preview dialog box are reflected directly in the open
document.

Last updated 5/10/2016

Print production tools (Acrobat Pro DC)

You can also access the Object Inspector from the Preview section of the Output Preview dialog box to inspect the
content of your document. For more information, see View information about the content of a PDF document.
Output Preview also includes access to the complete Ink Manager for remapping spot-color inks in both printing and
previewing. Ink mapping for previewing only applies when the Output Preview dialog box is open.
Note: If you are using a color management system (CMS) with accurately calibrated ICC profiles and have calibrated your
monitor, the onscreen separation preview colors more closely match the final color separation output.

2 Choose Output Preview in the right pane.

Choose simulation profile and preview options
Select an existing profile for simulating how your document looks when printed.
1 In the Output Preview dialog box, select an option from the Simulation Profile.
2 Select any of the following options:
Simulate Overprinting simulates the blending and overprinting of colors in the color-separated output.
Simulate Black Ink Simulates black and dark colors according to the black specified in the simulation profile.
Otherwise, blacks are mapped to the darkest color that the monitor can draw.
Simulate Paper Color simulates how colors may look when they are printed on the paper color. If you deselect this
option, then the paper color is monitor white.
Set Page Background Color Displays the page color. Click the colorswatch to select the color.

View colors by source space or preview specific elements
You can limit which colors are displayed in the preview. You can also view specific element types, such as solid color
objects, images, smooth shades, text, and line art. When you select a source color space, you see only the objects in that
color space. Limiting colors is useful, for example, for seeing whether a page contains any RGB color or where a spot
color is used.
1 In the Output Preview dialog box, select one of the available options from the Show menu.
2 Select Show Art, Trim, &amp; Bleed Boxes to preview any page boxes you’ve defined. For more information on defining

page boxes, see Set Page Boxes dialog box overview.

Preview color separations
You can preview separation plates and ink coverage to ensure that the printed piece meets your requirements. Although
previewing separations on your monitor can help you detect problems without the expense of printing separations, it
does not let you preview trapping, emulsion options, printer marks, and halftone screens and resolution. Those settings
are best verified with your print service provider using integral or overlay proofs.
Note: Objects on hidden layers are not included in an onscreen preview.
1 In the Output Preview dialog box, choose Separations from the Preview menu.
2 Do any of the following:

• To view one or more separations, select the empty box to the left of each separation name. Each separation
appears in its assigned color.
• To hide one or more separations, deselect the box to the left of each separation name.
• To view all process or spot plates at once, select the box for Process Plates or Spot Plates.

Note: A single process or spot plate appears as a black plate. This makes objects on a light-colored plate, such as yellow,
appear more visible.

Check ink coverage
Too much ink can saturate paper and cause drying problems or change the expected color characteristics of the
document. Total Area Coverage specifies the total percentage of all inks used. For example, 280 means 280% ink
coverage, which could be accomplished with 60C, 60M, 60Y, and 100K. Ask your print service provider for the
maximum ink coverage of the press you use for printing. You can then preview the document to identify areas where
total ink coverage exceeds the press limit. If you find any problems, you can Shift-click the area to insert a comment.
The comment is prepopulated with the ink coverage details.
1 In the Output Preview dialog box, choose Separations from the Preview menu.
2 Do one of the following:

• To set a sample size, choose an option from the Sample Size list. Point Sample specifies the value of the pixel you
click. 3 By 3 Average and 5 By 5 Average specify the average value of the specified number of pixels within the
area you click. Sample size does not have an impact on the Total Area Coverage warnings. It only has an impact
on the percentages next to each of the individual plates.
• To check for total document coverage, select TotalArea Coverage, and choose a number from the pop-up menu
or type a percentage in the box. Highlights identify areas where the ink coverage exceeds that percentage. To
change the highlight color, click the colorswatch and select a new color.
• To check for specific area coverage, use the pointer to hover over that area in the document window. Ink coverage
percentages appear in the ink list next to each ink name.
You can adjust ink coverage by converting some spot colors to process colors using the Ink Manager.
3 To record problems, shift-click the area. Acrobat DC inserts a comment that contains the ink coverage percentages.

Set the background color
You can simulate what your document would look like if printed on color paper.
1 In the Output Preview dialog box, choose Separations from the Preview menu.
2 Select the Set Page Background Color option at the top of the dialog box, and then select a color.

View color warnings
Output problems can occur when the colors in a document are not reproducible on a particular press, or when rich
black is used unintentionally on type. To diagnose such color problems before handing off a PDF for high-end output,
you can use the various color warnings in the Output Preview dialog box. Pixels in areas that trigger the warning are
displayed in the warning color, which is identified by the swatch color next to the warning type.
1 In the Output Preview dialog box, choose Color Warnings from the Preview menu.
2 Select either or both of the following options:
Show Overprinting Indicates where on the page overprinting appears in color-separated output. If you select
Simulate Overprinting in the Output panel of the Advanced Print Setup dialog box, you can also see overprinting
effects when you output to a composite printing device. This option is useful for proofing color separations.

By default, when you print opaque, overlapping colors, the top color knocks out the area underneath. You can use
overprinting to prevent knockout and make the topmost overlapping printing ink appear transparent in relation to
the underlying ink. The degree of transparency in printing depends on the ink, paper, and printing method used.

Print production tools (Acrobat Pro DC)

Rich Black Indicates areas that print as rich black—process black (K) ink mixed with color inks for increased opacity
and richer color. Rich black is used for large areas since you need the extra darkness to make the text look black
rather than gray.

Type the Start Cutoff percentage to define the minimum percentage of black to diagnose the content as rich black.
Rich black for this warning is a percentage of black (based on the cutoff value) and any nonzero C, M, or Y.
To change the warning color used in the preview, select a color from the swatches color picker.

View information about the content of a PDF document
Use the Object Inspector dialog box to view image resolution, color mode, transparency, and other information about
the content of a document. If you find any problems or issues with an object, you can Shift-click the object to insert a
comment. The comment is prepopulated with all the details found by the Object Inspector.
1 In the Preview section of the Output Preview dialog box, choose Object Inspector.
2 Click in the document window to view information about the objects that are under the pointer in the Output

Preview dialog box.
3 To note problem areas, shift-click the object. Acrobat DC inserts a comment that contains the information found by

the Object Inspector.

Transparency flattening (Acrobat Pro DC)
About flattening
If your document or artwork contains transparency, to be output it usually needs to undergo a process called flattening.
Flattening divides transparent artwork into vector-based areas and rasterized areas. As artwork becomes more complex
(mixing images, vectors, type, spot colors, overprinting, and so on), so does the flattening and its results.
Flattening may be necessary when you print or when you save or export to other formats that don’t support
transparency. To retain transparency without flattening when you create PDF files, save your file as Adobe PDF 1.4
(Acrobat 5.0) or later.
You can specify flattening settings and then save and apply them as transparency flattener presets. Transparent objects
are flattened according to the settings in the selected flattener preset.
Note: Transparency flattening cannot be undone after the file is saved.

For more information on transparency output issues, see the Print Service Provider Resources page of the Adobe
Solutions Network (ASN) (English only), available on the Adobe website.

Flattener Preview dialog box overview
Use the preview options in the Flattener Preview dialog box to highlight the areas and objects that are transparent, as
well as those affected by transparency flattening. Transparent content is highlighted in red, and the rest of the artwork
appears in grayscale.
Use this information to adjust the flattener options before you apply the settings, and then save them as flattener presets.
You can then apply these presets from other dialog boxes. For example, PDF Optimizer (Save As Other &amp;gt; Optimized
PDF), Advanced Print Setup dialog box, and the PostScript Settings dialog box (File &amp;gt; Export To).

Open the Flattener Preview dialog box
Choose Tools &amp;gt; Print Production &amp;gt;Flattener Preview.

Preview which areas of artwork will be flattened
Use the preview options in the Flattener Preview to highlight areas that are affected by flattening. You can use this colorcoded information to adjust flattening options.

Last updated 5/10/2016

Print production tools (Acrobat Pro DC)

Note: The Flattener Preview is not intended for precise previewing of spot colors, overprints, and blending modes. Instead,
use Overprint Preview mode for those purposes.
1 Display the Flattener Preview panel (or dialog box):

• In Illustrator, choose Window &amp;gt; Flattener Preview.
• In Acrobat, choose Tools &amp;gt; Print Production &amp;gt; Flattener Preview.
• In InDesign, choose Window &amp;gt; Output &amp;gt; Flattener Preview.
2 From the Highlight menu, choose the kind of areas you want to highlight. The availability of options depends on

the content of the artwork.
3 Select the flattening settings you want to use: Either choose a preset or, if available, set specific options.

Note: (Illustrator) If the flattening settings aren’t visible, select Show Options from the panel menu to display them.
4 If the artwork contains overprinted objects that interact with transparent objects, in Illustrator, select an option from

the Overprints menu. You can preserve, simulate, or discard overprints. In Acrobat, choose Preserve Overprint to
blend the color of transparent artwork with the background color to create an overprint effect.
5 At any time, click Refresh to display a fresh preview version based on your settings. Depending on the complexity

of the artwork, you may need to wait a few seconds for the preview image to appear. In InDesign, you can also choose
Auto Refresh Highlight.
In Illustrator and Acrobat, to magnify the preview, click in the preview area. To zoom out, Alt-click/Option-click in
the preview area. To pan the preview, hold down the spacebar and drag in the preview area.

Transparency Flattener options
You can set Transparency Flattener options when creating, editing, or previewing flattener presets in Illustrator,
InDesign, or Acrobat.

Highlight (preview) options
None (Color Preview) Disables previewing.
Rasterized Complex Regions Highlights the areas that will be rasterized for performance reasons (as determined by the

Rasters/Vectors slider). Keep in mind that the boundary of the highlight area has a higher probability of producing
stitching problems (depending on the print-driver settings and the rasterization resolution). To minimize stitching
problems, select Clip Complex Regions.
Transparent Objects Highlights the objects that are sources of transparency, such as objects with partial opacity
(including images with alpha channels), objects with blending modes, and objects with opacity masks. In addition, note
that styles and effects may contain transparency, and overprinted objects may be treated as sources of transparency if
they are involved in transparency or if the overprint needs to be flattened.
All Affected Objects Highlights all objects that are involved in transparency, including transparent objects and objects
that are overlapped by transparent objects. The highlighted objects will be affected by the flattening process—their
strokes or patterns will be expanded, portions of them may get rasterized, and so on.
Affected Linked EPS Files (Illustrator only) Highlights all linked EPS files that are affected by transparency.
Affected Graphics (InDesign only) Highlights all placed content affected by transparency or transparency effects. This
option is useful for service providers who need to see graphics that require attention to print properly.
Expanded Patterns (Illustrator and Acrobat) Highlights all patterns that will be expanded if involved in transparency.
Outlined Strokes Highlights all strokes that will be outlined if involved in transparency or because Convert All Strokes
To Outlines is selected.

Last updated 5/10/2016

523
Print production tools (Acrobat Pro DC)

Outlined Text (Illustrator and InDesign) Highlights all text that will be outlined if involved in transparency or because
Convert All Text To Outlines is selected.

Note: In the final output, outlined strokes and text may appear slightly different from native ones, especially very thin
strokes and very small text. However, the Flattener Preview doesn’t highlight this altered appearance.
Raster-Fill Text And Strokes (InDesign only) Highlights text and strokes that have rasterized fills as a result of flattening.
All Rasterized Regions (Illustrator and InDesign) Highlights objects and intersections of objects that will be rasterized

because there is no other way of representing them in PostScript or because they are more complex than the threshold
specified by the Rasters/Vectors slider. For example, the intersection of two transparent gradients will always be
rasterized, even if the Rasters/Vectors value is 100. The All Rasterized Regions option also shows raster graphics (such
as Photoshop files) involved in transparency, and raster effects such as drop shadows and feathers. Note that this option
takes longer to process than the others.

Transparency Flattener Preset options
Name/Preset Specifies the name of the preset. Depending on the dialog box, you can type a name in the Name text box
or accept the default. You can enter the name of an existing preset to edit that preset. However, you can’t edit the default
presets.
Raster/Vector balance Specifies the amount of vector information that will be preserved. Higher settings preserve

more vector objects, while lower settings rasterize more vector objects; intermediate settings preserve simple areas in
vector form and rasterize complex ones. Select the lowest setting to rasterize all the artwork.
Note: The amount of rasterization that occurs depends on the complexity of the page and the types of overlapping objects.
Line Art And Text Resolution Rasterizes all objects, including images, vector artwork, text, and gradients, to the

specified resolution. Acrobat and InDesign allow a maximum of 9600 pixels per inch (ppi) for line art, and 1200 ppi for
gradient mesh. Illustrator allows a maximum of 9600 ppi for both line art and gradient mesh. The resolution affects the
precision of intersections when flattened. Line Art and Text Resolution should generally be set to 600-1200 to provide
high-quality rasterization, especially on serif or small point sized type.
Gradient And Mesh Resolution Specifies the resolution for gradients and Illustrator mesh objects rasterized as a result

of flattening, from 72 to 2400 ppi. The resolution affects the precision of intersections when flattened. Gradient and
mesh resolution should generally be set between 150 and 300 ppi, because the quality of the gradients, drop shadows,
and feathers do not improve with higher resolutions, but printing time and file size increase.
Convert All Text To Outlines Converts all type objects (point type, area type, and path type) to outlines and discards all
type glyph information on pages containing transparency. This option ensures that the width of text stays consistent
during flattening. Note that enabling this option will cause small fonts to appear slightly thicker when viewed in
Acrobat or printed on low-resolution desktop printers. It doesn’t affect the quality of the type printed on highresolution printers or imagesetters.
Convert All Strokes To Outlines Converts all strokes to simple filled paths on pages containing transparency. This

option ensures that the width of strokes stays consistent during flattening. Note that enabling this option causes thin
strokes to appear slightly thicker and may degrade flattening performance.
Clip Complex Regions Ensures that the boundaries between vector artwork and rasterized artwork fall along object
paths. This option reduces stitching artifacts that result when part of an object is rasterized while another part of the
object remains in vector form. However, selecting this option may result in paths that are too complex for the printer
to handle.

Last updated 5/10/2016

524
Print production tools (Acrobat Pro DC)

Note: Some print drivers process raster and vector art differently, sometimes resulting in color stitching. You may be able to
minimize stitching problems by disabling some print-driver specific color-management settings. These settings vary with
each printer, so see the documentation that came with your printer for details.

(Illustrator only) Select Preserve Alpha Transparency (Flatten Transparency dialog box only) Preserves the overall

opacity of flattened objects. With this option, blending modes and overprints are lost, but their appearance is retained
within the processed artwork, along with the level of alpha transparency (as when you rasterize artwork using a
transparent background). Preserve Alpha Transparency can be useful if you are exporting to SWF or SVG, since both
of these formats support alpha transparency.
(Illustrator only) Select Preserve Spot Colors And Overprints (Flatten Transparency dialog box only) Generally
preserves spot colors. It also preserves overprinting for objects that aren’t involved in transparency. Select this option
when printing separations if the document contains spot colors and overprinted objects. Deselect this option when
saving files for use in page-layout applications. With this option selected, overprinted areas that interact with
transparency are flattened, while overprinting in other areas is preserved. The results are unpredictable when the file is
output from a page-layout application.
Preserve Overprint (Acrobat only) Blends the color of transparent artwork with the background color to create an

overprint effect.

About transparency flattener presets
If you regularly print or export documents that contain transparency, you can automate the flattening process by saving
flattening settings in a transparency flattener preset. You can then apply these settings for print output as well as for
saving and exporting files to PDF 1.3 (Acrobat 4.0) and EPS and PostScript formats. In addition, in Illustrator you can
apply them when saving files to earlier versions of Illustrator or when copying to the clipboard; in Acrobat, you can also
apply them when optimizing PDFs.
These settings also control how flattening occurs when you export to formats that don’t support transparency.
You can choose a flattener preset in the Advanced panel of the Print dialog box or of the format-specific dialog box that
appears after the initial Export or Save As dialog box. You can create your own flattener presets or choose from the
default options provided with the software. The settings of each of these defaults are designed to match the quality and
speed of the flattening with an appropriate resolution for rasterized transparent areas, depending on the document’s
intended use:
[High Resolution] is for final press output and for high-quality proofs, such as separations-based color proofs.
[Medium Resolution] is for desktop proofs and print-on-demand documents that will be printed on PostScript color

printers.
[Low Resolution] is for quick proofs that will be printed on black-and-white desktop printers and for documents that

will be published on the web or exported to SVG.

Color conversion and ink management (Acrobat Pro DC)

Last updated 5/10/2016

Print production tools (Acrobat Pro DC)

About color conversion
Colors must often be converted when they are displayed on a monitor or sent to a printer. Conversion is necessary when
the color models do not match (for example, when CMYK color is displayed on an RGB monitor, or when a document
with images in an RGB color space is sent to a printer).
Acrobat uses the source color spaces of objects in a PDF to determine what (if any) color conversion is required, for
example, from RGB to CMYK. For images and objects that contain embedded color profiles, Acrobat uses the
information in the profile to manage the appearance of the color. For files that comply with the PDF/X family of
standards, the OutputIntent is used to manage the colors in the file. Unmanaged colors, however, do not use profiles,
so a profile must be temporarily used for conversion. The Color Management panel of the Preferences dialog box
provides profiles for converting unmanaged colors. You can also select specific profiles based on local press conditions.

Convert Colors dialog box overview
If you output your PDF to a high-end device or incorporate it in a prepress workflow, you can convert color objects to
CMYK or another color space. Unlike other Acrobat features that temporarily convert colors during printing or
viewing, the Convert Colors feature changes the color values in the document. In the Convert Colors dialog box, you
can convert the colors of a single page or an entire document.
Note: The Convert Colors dialog box converts all colors in the document or all colors for specified object types to the
destination color space. To convert only the colors of a selected object, use the Edit Object tool.

Print production tools (Acrobat Pro DC)

Convert colors to a different color space
Depending on the color spaces you select, color conversion preserves, converts, or maps (aliases) color values from the
source color space to the destination space as follows:

• Objects with untagged (Device) data are converted to the destination space using the working space profiles as the
source. This conversion is applied to all untagged spaces, RGB, CMYK and grayscale, whether stand-alone or as
alternate value for spot colors.
• Objects in device-independent color spaces (CalGray, CalRGB, or Lab) can be preserved or converted. If converted,
Acrobat uses the device-independent object information.
• Objects set in spot colors can be preserved, converted, or mapped (aliased) to any other ink present in the document.
Objects include Separation, DeviceN, and NChannel color spaces. Spot colors can also be mapped to a CMYK
process color, if the process color model of the destination space is CMYK. Spot colors mapped to other inks can be
previewed in the Output Preview dialog box.
Note: If you want to convert specific spot plates, use Ink Manager in combination with the Convert Colors tool. To convert
only specific spot plates to process, map them to process in Ink Manager. Otherwise, all spots in the document are converted
to process if you have selected Spot Color as the color type.

Convert document colors
1 In the Convert Colors dialog box, select a conversion command. If the list contains no existing commands, click Add

to add the default conversion command.
2 Select the conversion command that you want to edit, and then select an option from the Matching Criteria:
Object Type Specifies if you want to convert the colors for all objects or for a specific type of object within the

3 Select one of the available convert commands:
Preserve Keeps objects in the selected color space when the document is output.
Convert To Profile Uses the destination space profile to convert color objects to a common ICC profile for an output

device.
Decalibrate Removes embedded profiles from the matching objects.

4 Specify the conversion profile.
5 Select the rendering intent to use for conversion. The default is Use Document Intent. If you select any of the other

intents, the selected intent overrides the document intent for the conversion.
6 Select Embed to embed the profile. Selecting Embed tags all objects with the selected conversion profile. As an

example, a document can contain five objects: one in grayscale and two each in the RGB and CMYK color spaces.
In this case, you can embed a separate color profile to calibrate the color for each color space, for a total of three
profiles. This process is useful if your RIP performs color management of PDFs or if you are sharing PDFs with other
users.
7 Select Convert Colors To Output Intent and specify the output intent profile to be used instead of the document’s

current output intent. An output intent describes the color reproduction characteristics of a possible output device
or production environment in which the document is printed. This choice is not available if the document does not
have an output intent. (PDFs that don't comply with standards, such as PDF/X or PDf/A, often lack an output
intent.)

Ink Manager overview
The Ink Manager provides control over inks at output time. Changes you make using the Ink Manager affect the output,
not how the colors are defined in the document.
Ink Manager options are especially useful for print service providers. For example, if a process job includes a spot color,
a service provider can open the document and change the spot color to the equivalent CMYK process color. If a
document contains two similar spot colors when only one is required, or if the same spot color has two different names,
a service provider can map the two to a single alias.
In a trapping workflow, the Ink Manager lets you set the ink density for controlling when trapping takes place, and it
lets you set the correct number and sequence of inks.
Note: InDesign and Acrobat share the same Ink Manager technology. However, only InDesign has the Use Standard Lab
Values For Spots option.

Separate spot colors as process
Using the Ink Manager, you can convert spot colors to process colors. When spot colors are converted to process color
equivalents, they are printed as separations rather than on a single plate. Converting a spot color is useful if you’ve
accidentally added a spot color to a process color document, or if the document contains more spot colors than are
practical to print.
1 In the Ink Manager, do one of the following:

• To separate individual spot colors, click the ink-type icon to the left of the spot color or alias ed spot color. A
process color icon appears. To change the color back to spot, click the icon again.
• To separate all spot colors, select Convert All Spots To Process. The icons to the left of the spot colors change to
process color icons. To restore the spot colors, deselect Convert All Spots To Process.
Note: Selecting Convert All Spots To Process removes any ink aliases you’ve set up in the Ink Manager and can also affect
overprinting and trapping settings in the document.
2 (InDesign only) To use the Lab values of a spot color rather than CMYK definitions, choose Use Standard Lab

Values For Spots.

Create an ink alias for a spot color
You can map a spot color to a different spot or process color by creating an alias. An alias is useful if a document
contains two similar spot colors when only one is required, or if it contains too many spot colors. You can see the effects
of ink aliasing in the printed output, and you see the effects onscreen if Overprint Preview mode is on.
1 In the Ink Manager, select the spot color ink you want to create an alias for.
2 Choose an option in the Ink Alias menu. The ink type icon and ink description change accordingly.

About ink trapping
When an offset printed document uses more than one ink on the same page, each ink must be printed in register
(perfectly aligned) with any other inks that it abuts, so that there is no gap where the different inks meet. However, it’s
impossible to ensure exact registration for every object on every sheet of paper running through a printing press, so
misregistration of inks can occur. Misregistration causes an unintended gap between inks.
You can compensate for misregistration by slightly expanding one object so that it overlaps an object of a different
color—a process known as trapping. By default, placing one ink over another knocks out, or removes, any inks
underneath to prevent unwanted color mixing; but trapping requires that inks overprint, or print on top of each other,
so that at least a partial overlap is achieved.

Most traps employ spreading—expanding a light object into a dark object. Because the darker of two adjacent colors
defines the visible edge of the object or text, expanding the lighter color slightly into the darker color maintains the
visual edge.

Adobe In-RIP trapping
Acrobat can automatically trap color documents with the Adobe In-RIP Trapping engine, which is available on Adobe
PostScript output devices that support Adobe In-RIP Trapping.
Adobe In-RIP Trapping can precisely calculate and apply any necessary adjustments to the edges of type and graphics
throughout your document. It can apply effective trapping techniques to different parts of a single object, even if the
object overlaps several different background colors. Trapping adjustments are made automatically, and you can define
trap presets to address the trapping requirements of specific page ranges. The effects of trapping are apparent only on
color separations generated by the trapping engine; you cannot see the results onscreen within the program.
The trapping engine decides where to trap by detecting contrasting color edges. It then creates traps based on the
neutral densities (lightness or darkness) of abutting colors, in most cases by spreading lighter colors into adjacent
darker colors. The trapping settings you specify in the Trap Presets palette modify the trapping engine’s results.
Requirements
Adobe In-RIP Trapping requires the following software and hardware:

• A PPD (PostScript Printer Description) file for a printer that supports Adobe In-RIP Trapping. You must select this
PPD by using the operating system driver.
• An Adobe PostScript Level 2 or later output device that uses a RIP that supports Adobe In-RIP Trapping. To find
out if a PostScript output device supports Adobe In-RIP Trapping, contact the manufacturer or your print service
provider.

Trap a PDF
Trapping is a complex process that depends on the interaction of various color, ink, and printing factors; the correct
settings vary, depending on specific press conditions. Do not change the default trap settings unless you’ve consulted
with your print service provider.
1 If necessary, choose Tools &amp;gt; Print Production &amp;gt; Trap Presets to create a trap preset with custom settings for your

document and printing press conditions.
2 Assign the trap preset to a page range.
3 Choose File &amp;gt; Print to open the Print dialog box, and then click Advanced.
4 Select Output from the list on the left.
5 For Color, choose In-RIP Separations.
6 For Trapping, choose Adobe In-RIP.

Note: This option works only when you target an output device that supports Adobe In-RIP Trapping.
7 Click Ink Manager. As necessary, select an ink, specify the following options (only if your service provider

recommends changing the settings), and then click OK:
Type Choose an ink type that describes the selected ink.
Neutral Density Type a value that differs from the default.
Trapping Sequence Type a value to set the order in which inks are printed.

8 Continue specifying other print options, and then click OK to print your document.

Specify settings using trap presets
A trap preset is a collection of trap settings you can apply to pages in a PDF. Use the Trap Presets dialog box for entering
trap settings and saving a collection of settings as a trap preset. If you don’t apply a trap preset to a trapping page range,
that page range will use the [Default] trap preset, a collection of typical trap settings that are applied to all pages of a
new document.
Note: In Acrobat, trap presets and their assignments apply to the document only while it is open; trap settings are not saved
in the PDF. This behavior is different from InDesign, where trap presets and their assignments are saved with the InDesign
document.

Create or modify a trap preset
Choose Tools &amp;gt; Print Production &amp;gt;Trap Presets.
1 Select an existing preset, and then click Create.
2 Specify the following options, and then click OK:
Name Type a name for the preset. You cannot change the name of either of the two built-in presets: [No Trap Preset]

and [Default].
Trap Width Type values to specify the amount of overlap for inks.
Trap Appearance Specify options for controlling the joins and ends of the traps.
Images Specify settings that determine how to trap images.
Trap Thresholds Type values to specify the conditions under which trapping occurs. Many variables affect the

values you’ll need to enter here. For more information, consult with your print service provider, and see the other
trapping topics.

Trap widths
Trap width is the amount of overlap for each trap. Differences in paper characteristics, screen rulings, and printing press
conditions require different trap widths. To determine the appropriate trap widths for each job, consult your
commercial printer.
Default Specifies the trap width in points for trapping all colors except those involving solid black. The default value is

0p0.25.
Black Indicates the distance that inks spread into solid black, or the holdback amount—the distance between black
edges and underlying inks for trapping rich blacks. The default value is 0p0.5. This value is often set to be 1.5 to 2 times
the value of the default trap width.

In InDesign, the value you set for Black Color determines the value for a solid black or a rich black, a process black (K)
ink mixed with color inks for increased opacity and richer color.
Note: (InDesign) If you choose Application Built-In trapping, and you specify a Default trap width or Black trap width
larger than 4 points, the resulting trap width is limited to 4 points. However, the value you specified will continue to be
displayed, because if you switch to Adobe In-RIP Trapping, traps larger than 4 points are applied as you specified.

Trap appearance
A join is where two trap edges meet at a common endpoint. You can control the shape of the outside join of two trap
segments and the intersection of three traps.
Join Style Controls the shape of the outside join of two trap segments. Choose from Miter, Round, and Bevel. The

default is Miter, which matches earlier trapping results to retain compatibility with previous versions of the Adobe
Trapping Engine.

End Style Controls the intersection of three-way traps. Miter (the default) shapes the end of the trap to keep it away

from the intersecting object. Overlap affects the shape of the trap generated by the lightest neutral density object that
intersects with two or more darker objects. The end of the lightest trap is wrapped around the point where the three
objects intersect.

Trap thresholds
Step Specifies the color change threshold at which the trapping engine creates a trap. Some jobs need only the most

extreme color changes trapped, while others require traps for more subtle color changes. The Step value indicates the
degree to which components (such as CMYK values) of abutting colors must vary before trapping occurs.
To change how much the component inks in abutting colors can vary before causing those colors to trap, increase or
decrease the value for Step in the New Trap Preset or Modify Trap Preset Options dialog box. The default is 10%. For
best results, use a value from 8% to 20%. Lower percentages increase sensitivity to color differences and result in more
traps.
Black Color Indicates the minimum amount of black ink required before the Black trap width setting is applied. The

default value is 100%. For best results, use a value no lower than 70%.
Black Density Indicates the neutral density value at or above which InDesign considers an ink to be black. For example,
if you want a dark spot ink to use the Black trap width setting, enter the neutral density value here. This value is typically
set near the default of 1.6.
Sliding Trap Determines when the trapping engine starts to straddle the centerline of the color boundary. The value
refers to the proportion of the lighter color’s neutral density value to a darker, abutting color’s neutral density value. For
example, setting the Sliding Trap value to 70% moves the point at which the trap begins to straddle the centerline to
where the lighter color exceeds 70% of the darker color in neutral density (lighter color’s neutral density divided by
darker color’s neutral density &amp;gt; 0.70). Colors of identical neutral density will always have their traps exactly straddle the
centerline, unless the Sliding Trap is set to 100%.
Trap Color Reduction Indicates the degree to which components from abutting colors are used to reduce the trap color.

This setting is useful for preventing certain abutting colors (such as pastels) from making an unsightly trap that is
darker than either color. Specifying a Trap Color Reduction lower than 100% begins to lighten the color of the trap; a
Trap Color Reduction value of 0% makes a trap with a neutral density equal to the neutral density of the darker color.

Trapping imported graphics
You can create a trap preset to control traps within images, and to control traps between bitmap images (such as
photographs and those saved in raster PDF files) and vector objects (such as those from a drawing program and vector
PDF files). Each trapping engine handles imported graphics differently. It’s important to be aware of these differences
when setting trapping options.
Trap Placement Provides options for determining where the trap falls when you trap vector objects (including objects

drawn in InDesign) to bitmap images. All options except Neutral Density create a visually consistent edge. Center
creates a trap that straddles the edge between objects and images. Choke causes objects to overlap the abutting image.
Neutral Density applies the same trapping rules as used elsewhere in the document. Trapping an object to a photograph
with the Neutral Density setting can result in noticeably uneven edges as the trap moves from one side of the edge to
another. Spread causes the bitmap image to overlap the abutting object.
Trap Objects To Images Ensures that vector objects (such as frames used as keylines) trap to images, using the Trap
Placement settings. If vector objects don’t overlap images in a trapping page range, consider turning this option off to
speed trapping of that page range.
Trap Images To Images Turns on trapping along the boundary of overlapping or abutting bitmap images. This feature

is on by default.
Trap Images Internally Turns on trapping among colors within each individual bitmap image (not just where they
touch vector artwork and text). Use this option only for page ranges containing simple, high-contrast images, such as
screen shots or cartoons. Leave it unselected for continuous-tone and other complicated images, as it will create bad
traps. Trapping is faster when this option is unselected.

Last updated 5/10/2016

536
Print production tools (Acrobat Pro DC)

Trap 1-Bit Images Ensures that 1-bit images trap to abutting objects. This option doesn’t use the Image Trap Placement
settings, because 1-bit images use only one color. In most cases, leave this option selected. In some cases, such as with
1-bit images where pixels are widely spaced, selecting this option may darken the image and slow the trapping.

About trapping black
When creating or editing presets, the value you type for Black Color determines what is considered solid black and rich
black. A rich black is any black color that uses a support screen—additional percentages of one or more process inks to
strengthen the black.
The Black Color setting is useful when you must compensate for extreme dot gain (as when using low-grade paper
stock). These situations cause black percentages lower than 100% to print as solid areas. By screening back blacks or
rich blacks (using tints of solid black) and decreasing the Black Color setting from its default of 100%, you can
compensate for dot gain and ensure that the trapping engine will apply the proper trap width and placement to black
objects.
When a color reaches the Black Color value, the Black trap width value is applied to all abutting colors, and keepaway
traps are applied to rich black areas using the Black trap width value.
If support screens extend all the way to the edge of a black area, any misregistration causes the edges of support screens
to become visible, creating an unwanted halo or distorting the edges of objects. The trapping engine uses a keepaway,
or a holdback, for rich blacks to keep support screens a specified distance away from edges of reversed-out or light
elements in the foreground, so that the light elements retain their sharpness. You control the distance of support screens
from the edges of black areas by specifying the Black trap width value.
Note: If the element you’re trapping is a thin element, such as a black keyline around graphics, the trapping engine overrides
the Black trap width setting and limits the trap to half the width of the thin element.

Adjusting ink neutral density values
By adjusting the ink neutral density (ND) values that the selected trapping engine uses, you can determine the precise
placement of traps. The default ND values for process inks are based on the neutral density readings of process ink
swatches that conform to industry standards in different parts of the world. The language version determines which
standard it conforms to. For example, the ND values for the U.S. English and Canadian versions conform to the
Specifications for Web Offset Publications (SWOP) solid ink density values published by the Graphic Arts Technical
Foundation of North America. You can adjust process ink neutral densities to match printing industry standards in
other parts of the world.
The trapping engine derives the ND values for a spot color from its CMYK equivalent. For most spot colors, the ND
values of their CMYK equivalents are accurate enough for proper trap creation. Spot inks that aren’t easily simulated
using process inks, such as metallic inks and varnishes, may need their ND values adjusted so that the trapping engine
can trap them correctly. By typing new values, you can ensure that an ink that is observably darker or lighter is
recognized that way by the trapping engine; the appropriate trap placement is then applied automatically.
You can get the appropriate neutral density value for a given ink by asking your commercial printer. The most accurate
method of determining an ink’s ND value is by measuring a swatch of the ink with a commercial densitometer. Read
the “V” or visual density of the ink (don’t use process filters). If the value differs from the default setting, type the new
value in the ND text box.
Note: Changing the neutral density for a spot color affects only how that color will trap. It doesn’t change the appearance
of that color in your document.

Last updated 5/10/2016

537
Print production tools (Acrobat Pro DC)

Follow these guidelines when adjusting ND values:
Metallic and opaque inks Metallic inks are usually darker than their CMYK equivalents, while opaque inks obscure
any ink beneath them. In general, you should set the ND values for both metallic and opaque spot colors much higher
than their default values to ensure that these spot colors won’t spread.

Note: Setting an ink to Opaque or Opaque Ignore in the Type menu of the Ink Manager prevents an opaque ink from
spreading into other colors, unless another opaque ink has a higher ND value.
Pastel inks These inks are normally lighter than their process equivalents. You may want to set the ND value for these
inks lower than their default values to ensure that they spread into adjacent darker colors.
Other spot inks Some spot colors, such as turquoise or neon orange, are significantly darker or lighter than their
CMYK equivalents. You can determine whether this is the case by comparing printed swatches of the actual spot inks
to printed swatches of their CMYK equivalents. You can adjust the spot ink’s ND value higher or lower as necessary.

Customize trapping for specialty inks
Using certain inks involves special trapping considerations. For example, if you are using a varnish on your document,
you don’t want the varnish to affect trapping. However, if you’re overprinting certain areas with a completely opaque
ink, you don’t need to create traps for items underneath. Ink options are available for these situations. It’s usually best
not to change the default settings, unless your prepress service provider recommends changing them.
Note: The speciality inks and varnishes used in the document may have been created by mixing two spot inks or by mixing
a spot ink with one or more process inks.
1 Open the Ink Manager and select an ink that requires special treatment.
2 For Type, choose one of the following options, and then click OK:
Normal Use for traditional process inks and most spot inks.
Transparent Use for clear inks to ensure that underlying items trap. Use this option for varnishes and dieline inks.
Opaque Use for heavy, nontransparent inks to prevent trapping of underlying colors but allow for trapping along

the ink’s edges. Use this option for metallic inks.
Opaque Ignore Use for heavy, nontransparent inks to prevent trapping of underlying colors and to prevent trapping

along the ink’s edges. Use this option for those inks, such as metallic and varnishes, that have undesirable
interactions with other inks.

Adjust the trapping sequence
The trapping sequence (also called the trapping order) matches the order in which inks are printed at the press, but it
doesn’t match the order in which separations are produced at the output device.
The trapping sequence is particularly important when you’re printing with multiple opaque colors, such as metallic
inks. Opaque inks with lower sequence numbers are spread under opaque inks with higher sequence numbers. This
process prevents the last applied ink from being spread, and it still creates good traps.
Note: Don’t alter the default trapping sequence without first consulting with your prepress service provider.
1 Open the Ink Manager. The current trapping sequence is displayed in the Sequence column of the inks list.
2 Select an ink, type a new value for Trapping Sequence, and then press Tab. The sequence number of the selected ink

changes, and the other sequence numbers change accordingly.
3 Repeat the previous step for as many inks as necessary, and then click OK.

About preflight profiles
The success of a preflight inspection depends on how well you define the criteria for the inspection. The inspection
criteria are packaged in a file called a preflight profile. A preflight profile includes one or more checks, fixups, or both
checks and fixups. Each check includes one or more property statements that validate the PDF content. Preflight shows
an error only if all the property statements in the check are in error. In the Preflight Edit Profile dialog box, you can
specify which values to use and how to handle mismatches. For example, you can choose a profile that simply reports
mismatches, or one that automatically fixes a mismatch according to its specified parameters. A profile with a fixup has
the filled-in gray wrench icon next to it.
Adobe Acrobat includes several predefined preflight profiles, organized into groups, such as Digital Printing, PDF
Analysis, Prepress, and PDF/A, PDF/E, or PDF/X Compliance. You can use the predefined profiles as is or modify them
to create custom profiles. The checks that make up the profiles (called rules in previous versions of Acrobat) are
organized by categories, such as Document, Pages, Images, and so on. Each check in a category governs a particular
document property.
To help you determine what document properties the preflight profile analyzes, you can review information about each
selected check in the Preflight Edit Profile dialog box. This information describes what criteria the check uses to
analyze, and possibly fix, a document property.

Preflight Edit Profile dialog box overview
The Preflight Edit Profile dialog box lists all available profiles and shows which document properties are being
analyzed. From this dialog box you can unlock and lock a profile, create a new group for organizing profiles, and specify
inspection criteria. You can access additional options and information by expanding the profile.
To open the Preflight Edit Profile dialog box, expand a profile group in the Preflight dialog box, select a profile, and
click Edit (or choose Edit Preflight Profiles from the Options menu).

Add and remove profiles
You can create your own custom preflight profiles. Before you create a new profile from scratch, review existing profiles
for ones that achieve results similar to those you want. If possible, duplicate an existing profile and modify only the
relevant portion.
A preflight profile must contain at least one check or fix and one property that validate the PDF content. When you
build a check from scratch, you can use existing properties or create new properties as you go. For best results when
creating and modifying profiles, add only as many checks as you need to validate the PDF content, and keep the checks
and properties simple and straightforward. For example, you can use a PDF/X profile to check for certain criteria, and
then add checks for non-PDF/X criteria, such as image resolution.

Create a profile
1 In the Profiles panel of the Preflight dialog box, click the Select Profiles button

.

2 Choose Options &amp;gt; Create New Preflight Profile.
3 Type a name and purpose for the new profile and specify other options as desired.

By default, newly created profiles appear under the Custom Profiles group, unless you assigned them to a different
group.
4 Expand the profile in the column on the left.

Import or export preflight profiles
Preflight profiles can be shared with other users. For example, print service providers can provide them to their
customers to ensure that jobs pass an inspection defined by those profiles before the jobs are handed off. Users in a
workgroup can create their own profiles as a way to check a document before uploading to the web or printing to a
special printer, or to check in-house production.
To exchange a profile, you package it for import and export. The package includes all checks and properties for the
selected profile.

Import a preflight profile
1 Do one of the following:

• In the Preflight dialog box, choose Import Preflight Profile from the Options menu.
• In the Preflight Edit Profile dialog box, click the Import icon

Viewing preflight problems inside the PDF structure
For detailed information on PDF structure, see the documents on the Adobe PDF Technology Center at
www.adobe.com/go/learn_acr_pdftechnology_en (English only). If you have advanced knowledge of the PDF file
format, examine the internal structure of the PDF and its fonts for technical reasons for a preflight mismatch. Preflight
includes three options for in-depth inspection of a PDF. Technically skilled users can use these tools to analyze the
objects and fonts that caused a mismatch.
In-depth knowledge of font internal structures, and font specifications for Type 1, TrueType, and OpenType fonts is
important. The font specifications are listed in the bibliography of the guide.
Note: You can navigate the PDF and fonts in the windows that appear, but you can’t edit the PDF structure or fonts.

Browse the internal PDF structure
View the structure of a PDF, as defined by content streams and cos objects, in a tree array. (Content streams represent
pages, form XObjects, Type 3 font characters, and the appearance of comments and form fields. Cos objects include such
items as color space, images, and XObjects.)

Last updated 5/10/2016

Preflight (Acrobat Pro DC)

Check PDF syntax, view the results of a fixup, or determine the cause of a mismatch. Choose between five view modes
that organize content streams in different ways. You cannot edit the PDF in the Internal PDF Structure window.
Note: Do not confuse the internal structure with the logical structure in tagged PDFs that improves accessibility for low- or
non-sighted readers. The internal structure is a superset of all objects in the document, including tags.
Before you can browse the internal PDF structure, you must run a preflight check.
1 In the Preflight window, choose Browse Internal PDF Structure from the Options menu.

The Internal PDF Structure window opens, showing a tree view of the document information and the document
catalog (the root of the document’s object hierarchy).
2 Expand each tree item to view the document structure.
3 Click the Page button

to view the structure of each page.

4 To change how content streams appear in the tree view, select a view mode in the toolbar:
Classic

Displays the content stream as a sequence of page content operators. Expand the subtree for an operator to view its
operands. This is the default view.
Q

Groups all operators in the content stream that belong to the same graphic state nesting level within a pair of the
q/Q operators. Expand the subtree for a q/Q pair to view the operator and parameters inside.
BMC

Similar to Q, but arranges content streams by marked content (BMC/EMC) nesting levels.
BT/ET

Arranges content streams by text blocks, which are enclosed by BT and ET operators.
Snippet

Displays content streams as a series of snippets. A snippet is a contiguous group of objects that share the same
graphic state. In this view, each snippet represents a type of drawing operation (for example, paint area) and its
graphic state.

Browse the internal font structure
View the internal structure of embedded fonts in a PDF in greater detail than the preflight results with a graphical view
that shows the outline and coordinates of each glyph. You can determine the source of various preflight problems, such
as mismatches caused by inconsistent glyph widths.
Before you can browse the internal font structure, you must run a preflight check.
1 In the Preflight window, choose Browse Internal Structure Of All Document Fonts from the Options menu.

To view the structure of a single font, expand the Fonts entry in Results &amp;gt; Overview. Then select a font and choose
Browse Internal Font Structure from the Options menu.
2 To view the glyph details, click any of the following buttons:
Display Grid

Shows the origin of the glyph’s coordinate space, indicated by two green-colored orthogonal lines.
Display Boxes

Preflight (Acrobat Pro DC)

Shows the area used by the selected glyph and the maximum area used by all glyphs using blue lines that coincide
on the top and bottom.
Display Filling

Shows the areas of a filled glyph as medium gray.
Display Points

Shows all the points used to define the glyph’s outline. Black points indicate the outline’s contour. Red points indicate
bezier curves and are offset from the outline’s contour.
Display Cursor

Shows the position of the currently selected point, indicated by two magenta-colored orthogonal lines. This button
is available only if Display Points is selected.

Create a results report
You can capture the results of a preflight inspection in various types of reports. You can capture the results in a text file,
an XML file, or a single PDF file. A PDF report can include just an overview or detailed information presented in
different ways.
A PDF report includes information about the document and problem objects in layers, which you turn on or off in the
Layers navigation pane.
Note: You can also create an inventory of all objects and resources used in the PDF.

Create a report of preflight results
1 In the Results panel of the Preflight dialog box, click Create Report, or choose Create Report from the Options

menu.
2 Specify a name and location for the report. The suffix “_report” is automatically added to the report name.
3 Select the type of report, and click Save.

Report types
PDF Report Creates a summary of problems accompanied by details that are shown using transparent masks,

comments, or layers for each problem object.
Overview Condenses the preflight results into a short document that includes applied fixups, a results summary, and

document information.

Preflight (Acrobat Pro DC)

Details Reports additional information about each problem object—for example, where the object is located on the
page. Problems Highlighted By Transparent Masks places a colored mask, similar to a Photoshop mask, over areas to
make the problem areas stand out. You can change the mask color using Preflight preferences. Problems Highlighted
By Comments inserts preflight results as comments. Problems Highlighted By Layers shows the file separated into
layers of mismatches or found objects according to the criteria used in the profile itself. Another layer calledOther
Objects includes objects that have nothing to do with the profile used.
XML Report Produces a structured report for workflow systems that can interpret and process the preflight results. For
details, contact your print service provider.
Text Report Produces a report in plain text format, with each line indented according to the hierarchy in the Preflight
Results dialog box. You can open the report in a text editor.

1 In the navigation pane for the PDF report, click the Layers button

to open the Layers panel.

2 In the Layers panel, expand the report and click the square to the left of a layer name to hide or show the layer.

About inventory reports
An inventory report shows resources used in a PDF, including color spaces, images, patterns, shadings, metadata, and
fonts and glyphs in each font family. Related information is grouped together and arranged on a PDF page so that you
can scan and locate items. You can run an inventory report before or after you run a preflight inspection. Unlike a
preflight results report, which provides only the information requested by checks in the selected profile, an inventory
report does not filter the PDF content. Together, a preflight inspection report and an inventory report can help you
identify and fix problems.
The information in an inventory report can be useful when you perform tasks such as these:

• Exploring files that seem unusual, such as those created by an unknown application, or files with slow screen redraw
or copy-and-paste actions that don’t work.
• Examining processing issues, such as failure to print correctly, or problems encountered during color conversion,
imposition, placement on an InDesign page, and so on.
• Identifying aspects of a PDF that are not ideal, such as the inadvertent embedding of a font because of an unnoticed
space character on a master page, or cropped images with extraneous image data, or objects that are not of the
expected type (such as type or vector objects converted to images or merged with an image).
• Providing additional information about an object besides its presence. For example, by locating a spot color in the
inventory report, you can determine whether it is used by itself or in combination with other colorants, such as in a
duotone image. Or you can determine which glyphs in a font are embedded, what they look like, and which
character they are supposed to represent. This information can help you resolve a missing-glyph error.
• Exploring XMP metadata embedded with the file, such as its author, resolution, color space, copyright, and
keywords applied to it. This information is stored in a standardized way using the Extensible Metadata Platform
(XMP) standard.

Create an inventory of PDF content
1 In the Preflight dialog box, choose Create Inventory from the Options menu.
2 Select the types of objects and resources you want included in the inventory. In addition to fonts, colors, images, and

so on, you can include the following information:
Form XObjects

Last updated 5/10/2016

549
Preflight (Acrobat Pro DC)

Objects that are referenced within a PDF. For example, if a PDF contains many occurrences of the same object, it
exists as a single resource that is referenced many times.
Include XMP Metadata
Includes information embedded in the PDF that can be used by an XMP-enabled application or device in the
workflow. This information can include meaningful descriptions and titles, searchable keywords, the author’s name,
and copyright information. If you select Include Advanced Fields, you can include the fields and structures used for
storing the metadata using namespaces and properties. This advanced information appears as a text-based tree view
of all the XMP data in the PDF, both for the document as well as for those images in the PDF for which XMP
metadata is present.
Note: You can also view the metadata for the PDF document as a whole in the Document Properties dialog box. Choose

the preflight inspection.
• If you switched to a different view in the Preflight dialog box, click Results to get back to the Results list.
• To see an object in context on the PDF page, double-click the item. The object is highlighted with a dotted line
for easier identification. This option is useful when an object such as a font exists in multiple places in the
document. In some cases, the item is an attribute of an object (for example, a color space). In those cases, the
inspection finds the objects that use the attribute.
You can change the type of line, its thickness, and its color on the Highlighting tab of Preflight preferences.

Output intents in PDFs (Acrobat Pro DC)
More Help topics
Analyzingdocuments with the Preflight tool (Acrobat Pro DC)

About output intents
An output intent describes the final destination device you will use to reproduce the color in the PDF, such as the
separations printing device. Output intents override working spaces during viewing and printing, but they do not
convert the colors in the PDF.
Note: In a PDF/X1-a workflow, the output intent describes the working CMYK space. In a PDF/X-3 workflow, the
embedded ICC profile in the output intent is used to dynamically convert any objects with color-managed color to the color
space of the ICC profile in the output intent. In most cases this will be CMYK, but can also be RGB or Grayscale.

Last updated 5/10/2016

553
Preflight (Acrobat Pro DC)

There are two kinds of output intents: One includes an embedded device profile that defines the color space of the
destination device, such as U.S. Web Coated (SWOP) v2; the other is a name that defines the destination color space
and usually names a standard output condition. Using a named output intent rather than an embedded profile helps
reduce the size of a PDF, but this is typically only possible for PDF/X-1a files, or PDF/X-3 files that do not contain colormanaged color.
You include output intents when you create PDF/X (or PDF/A) files, using the Standards panel of the Adobe PDF
Settings dialog box. (You access Adobe PDF Settings differently, depending on the application you’re using.) You can
also use third-party plug-ins to include output intents. For documents with named output intents rather than
embedded profiles, the program looks for the color profile associated with the named intent.

Create output intents
1 Choose Tools &amp;gt; Print Production &amp;gt; Preflight. On the Output Intents tab of Preflight Preferences, do one of the

following:

• To create a new output intent from scratch, click the Create A New Output Intent icon

.

• To create an output intent based on an existing one, select an option from the list on the left, and then click the
Duplicate Selected Output Intent icon
. An integer is appended to the name of the duplicated output intent.
2 Set output intent options.

Extract an output intent for reuse
You can extract an embedded output intent from another PDF, and then add it to the list of output intents in Preflight

1 On the Output Intents tab of Preflight Preferences, click Capture.
2 Locate the file with the embedded output intent you want and open it.

The output intent appears at the end of the list, with a name that indicates it was captured from a certain type of file,

Correcting problem areas with the Preflight tool
(Acrobat Pro DC)
About preflight fixups
You can use the Preflight tool to fix many errors in a document. To do this, you add error corrections, called fixups, to
a profile. The fixup automatically corrects the problem, if possible, or provides information so that you can correct the
problem in the source file. A profile with a fixup has the gray wrench icon next to it. An outline of a wrench means that
no fixups are associated with the profile.
Preflight includes several predefined fixups that you can add to a profile. These cover a broad range of errors that affect
color, fonts, images, print production, compliance with international standards like PDF/X and PDF/A, and other areas.
Preflight also includes a toolkit for creating your own single fixups.
Note: A fixup permanently changes the document.
For example, fixups can perform the following actions to correct errors:

• Convert color spaces, just as the Convert Color feature does.
• Repair documents and eliminate unneeded content to reduce file size, just as PDF Optimizer does.
• Convert the PDF to a different version.
• Widen hairlines.
• Flatten transparency.
• Remove objects outside the trim and bleed boxes.
• Prepare the PDF for PDF/X, PDF/E, or PDF/A conversions.
• Set document information.

Add fixups to a profile
The Preflight tool includes a collection of fixups that you can add to a profile. These are all available from the Fixups
section of each profile.
1 Open the Preflight dialog box (Tools &amp;gt; Print Production &amp;gt; Preflight), select a profile, and click the Edit link next

Edit Fixup dialog box overview
The Edit Fixup dialog box lists the types of predefined fixups you can add to a profile, and the values associated with
each fixup. You can use the Edit Fixup dialog box to change the values associated with a fixup, or create a custom fixup
based on an existing one. Like checks, fixups are organized by categories.

A Fixup name B Fixup categories C Fixup criteria D Button for seeing which profiles use the fixup E Search F Areas in the fixup that can be

Create or modify fixups
You can create a custom fixup for certain jobs or output devices. The settings you specify determine such things as what
output intent is used, what color conversions take place, how images are compressed and sampled, and what PDF
compatibility level the PDF must support. Although you can modify any of the predefined fixups, as long as they are
unlocked, it is better to duplicate an existing fixup and change its values. This technique is useful if the fixup belongs
to multiple locked profiles, and you don’t want to find and unlock all those profiles. A duplicated fixup is unlocked by
default because it does not yet belong to a profile. You can also create a single fixup that can be quickly run without it
being part of a profile.

Automating document analysis with droplets or
preflight actions (Acrobat Pro DC)

Last updated 5/10/2016

Preflight (Acrobat Pro DC)

About droplets and actions
If you routinely use the same preflight profile to inspect documents, you can use a droplet or a preflight action to
process files.
A droplet in Preflight is a small application that runs a Preflight inspection on one or more PDFs that you drag onto the
. You can save a droplet on the desktop or to another location on your computer.
Droplet icon
Like droplets, a preflight action inspects multiple files at once, separates successful files from problem files, and creates
reports in designated locations. In addition, hot folders can convert multiple file types (JPEG, HTML, RTF, and so on)
to PDF or to PDF/X using conversion settings you specify; inspect the files using specified profiles; and output them in
any format Acrobat supports, including PDF and PostScript.
Note: If you are inspecting only files, you probably don’t need to save changes or save copies in output folders.

Create and edit a droplet for running a preflight inspection
When you inspect files using a droplet, you can separate successful files from problem files, and review results in an
optional report.

Create a droplet
1 Choose Tools &amp;gt; Print Produciton &amp;gt; Preflight, and then Create Preflight Droplet from the Options menu in the

Preflight dialog box.
2 Choose a Preflight profile from the pop-up menu. Create a new one if the exact profile you need is not listed.
3 Specify settings for handling the PDFs after the preflight inspection, and then save the droplet.

Analyzing documents with the Preflight tool (Acrobat
Pro DC)
To verify that your Adobe® PDF contains only the features, fonts, and formatting that you’ve specified, use the Preflight
tool to inspect and, in certain cases, correct the document’s contents.

About preflight inspections
The Preflight tool analyzes the contents of a PDF to determine its validity for print production and a variety of other
conditions that you can specify. Preflight inspects the file against a set of user-defined values, called preflight profiles.
Depending on the profile, the preflight inspection can also correct certain errors. Preflight also runs checks and fixups
on visible areas or certain objects, and makes PDFs comply with various standards.
Preflight identifies issues with colors, fonts, transparency, image resolution, ink coverage, PDF version compatibility,
and more. Preflight also includes tools for examining PDF syntax or the actual PDF structure of a document.
Before you use the Preflight tool or create a PDF for print, follow these recommendations:

• If you created PDFs using Acrobat Distiller, InDesign, or Illustrator, optimize them for print or press. Use either the
predefined settings in Distiller or InDesign PDF styles, or settings provided by your print service provider.
• Embed all fonts from within the authoring application. Embedding ensures that fonts aren’t substituted.

The Preflight dialog box
Use the Preflight dialog box to control all aspects of the preflight inspection. If the Print Production panel is not visible
in the right pane, choose Tools &amp;gt; Print Production. Then choose Preflight in the right pane.

Analyzing documents with the Preflight tool (Acrobat Pro DC)

About additional checks and properties
The Preflight tool includes a collection of additional checks (called rules in previous versions of Acrobat) that you can
add to a profile. These checks are available from the Custom Checks section of each profile. You can modify these
checks in a variety of ways, depending on the PDF property they describe. You can also create single checks that can be
quickly run without being part of a profile. If single checks are run, all flagged content appears in the results as errors.
Some properties are defined by a simple statement that is either true or false for a given object in a PDF—for example,
“Font is not embedded” or “Color managed color used.” Some property statements specify relationships between the
actual value of a property (for example, text size or spot color name) and the value you enter in the dialog box (for
example, “12” or “Deep blue”). Other statements compare numerical values.

explanation of how the Preflight tool uses the properties.

Last updated 5/10/2016

563
Preflight (Acrobat Pro DC)

The following property groups are available:
Text Includes information about how text is rendered, whether it is scaled anamorphically or slanted, or whether it can

be mapped to Unicode and thus copied or exported correctly.
Font Describes all aspects of a font in which text is rendered. Note that text size is a text property, not a font property,

because a font can be used at many sizes throughout a PDF document. Text size is included in the Text property group.
Image Includes image resolution, bit depth, number of pixels, rendering intent, and more.
Colors Includes color characteristics, such as color spaces, alternate color spaces, patterns, and spot colors. Alternate
color spaces enable Acrobat to display or print certain spot colors and multicomponent spot colors (DeviceN). For
example, to reproduce the color orange on a monitor or printer, the PDF requires an alternate color space (made up of
RGB or CMYK colors) that defines what the spot color looks like.
ICC Color Spaces Includes properties for accessing the characteristics in the embedded ICC profiles, which define the
ICC color spaces. ICC profiles contain data for translating device-dependent color to a device-independent color space,
such as Lab. This helps you reproduce color consistently across different platforms, devices, and ICC-compliant
applications (such as Adobe Illustrator and Adobe InDesign). A document that contains objects in different color
spaces (such as RGB, CMYK, and Grayscale) could have different ICC profiles for calibrating the color for each color
space.
Graphic State Properties For Fill Includes graphic state information about how areas are filled, particularly the color

values of the current color space.
Graphic State Properties For Stroke Includes graphic state information about how lines are drawn, particularly the

color values of the current color space, as well as line-specific properties, such as thickness.
General Graphic State Properties Includes settings that control how text, graphics, or images are displayed in a PDF

page. Overprint settings, for example, are included here.
Halftone Includes graphic state settings relevant to prepress operations, such as screen angles, frequencies, and spot

shapes.
Page Description Includes general information about objects on a PDF page, such as the type of object (for example,

whether it is an image, a piece of text, or a smooth shade) or whether it is inside or outside the viewable area of the page,
or how far it is from the trim box.
OPI Includes properties for analyzing all existing OPI links (comments), whether from OPI version 1.3 or 2.0. The
possible OPI entries in a PDF are the same as in PostScript files.
Embedded PostScript Refers to the PostScript code that can be embedded into the PDF. There are three properties: one

for a PostScript operator used directly in a page description; one for PostScript code embedded in a PostScript XObject;
and one for an early form of a PostScript XObject, a PostScript Form XObject.
Object Metadata Includes information embedded with the object, such as its creator, resolution, color space, copyright,

and keywords applied to it. For example, if a Photoshop image with metadata is placed in an InDesign document, and
the document is converted to PDF, this information can be retrieved and checked by properties in this group.
Annotations Includes most characteristics of comments and drawing markups, traps, and printer marks.
Form Fields Includes properties for form fields.
Layers Checks for optional content, which sometimes affect the appearance of a page.
Pages Includes page numbers and page sizes that represent the various document boxes supported by Adobe PDF 1.3
and later technology (media box, bleed box, trim box, and art box). This group also includes plate names for PDF pages
that belong to a preseparated PDF.

Last updated 5/10/2016

Preflight (Acrobat Pro DC)

Document Includes all the pieces of information that apply to the PDF as a whole, such as whether the document is

encrypted, contains form fields, or contains bookmarks.
Document Info Lists all the standard entries that can also be accessed by the Document Info dialog box in Acrobat, and

information that has been standardized by the ISO 15930 standard (PDF/X).
Document Metadata Includes information embedded within the document, such as its title, author, copyright, and

keywords applied to it. This information is also available in the Document Metadata section of the Document
Properties dialog box in Acrobat. (Choose File &amp;gt; Properties, click the Description tab, and then click Additional
Metadata.)
Signatures Includes information about the signatures in the document.
Structured PDF Includes several basic properties for the tagging structure in a tagged PDF, for which the PDF/A

standard defines constraints.
Output Intents For PDF/X, PDF/A, or PDF/E Defines which output process the PDF has been prepared for. A PDF

intended for high-resolution printed output typically contains an output intent with an embedded ICC profile, for use
by a proofing device or a device’s RIP (raster image processor).
Output Intent For PDF/X, PDF/A, or PDF/E (ICC Profile Properties) Includes properties for accessing information from

an ICC profile embedded in the output intent. This group includes the same properties as ICC profiles for objects, such
as profile name and type. The ICC profile describes the output condition of the device where the document will be
imaged.
Efficiency Of PDF Content Stream Helps determine how efficiently page descriptions are encoded. For example, it is

possible to include the text Hello as a text operator for the whole word, or as several text operators for each character
in the word. The latter is less efficient and reduces the speed of page rendering. The efficiency checks return percentages
for several types of operators. A smaller value in most cases is better than a higher value.
Errors In PDF Syntax Returns information about specific errors in the syntax of a PDF. For example, if certain keys

required by the PDF specification are not included, Acrobat may still be able to render the file. For predictable PDF
rendering, however, it is preferable to encode all PDFs in strict compliance with the PDF specification.
Errors In Structured PDF Returns information about errors in the tag structure of a tagged PDF. For example, an error

is returned if the type of a tagged object is not properly specified. The properties in this group help identify errors in
tag structure.
Errors In PDF Content Stream Returns information about errors in the page descriptions in a PDF. For example, three
number operands are required to define RGB color. If there are fewer than three operators, it is not possible to render
the page. Properties in this group help determine the reasons why a PDF page isn’t rendered.

Preflight Edit Profile dialog box overview (Custom Checks)

Add checks to a profile
Acrobat includes several predefined preflight profiles, which you can use as is or modify to create custom profiles. You
can modify a profile that nearly meets your needs by adding one or more checks that analyze the document using
different criteria. For example, an existing check might detect all text that is not plain black—that is, text that uses black
plus some amount of cyan, magenta, and yellow. Because this could be a problem when you print small text, you could
modify the check so that it flags text objects that use more than one color and have a text size equal to or smaller than
12 points.
You can reuse a check in any profile where it’s needed. Keep in mind, however, that if you modify a check that’s being
used in multiple profiles, the check is modified in every profile that uses it. To avoid making unnecessary modifications,
rename the check for a particular profile. Before editing a preflight profile, you must unlock it.
1 In the Preflight dialog box, select a profile, and click the Edit link next to the profile name, or choose Edit Preflight

Profiles from the Options menu.
2 Choose Unlocked from the pop-up menu at the upper left.
3 Select Custom Checks from the list of items displayed under the profile name.
4 Work with the panels by doing any of the following:

• To quickly find a specific check, type all or part of its name in the search box. Only those items containing the
search term are displayed. Removing the name from the search box displays all the checks again.

• To add a check to the profile, select the check in the right panel, click the left-facing arrow, and adjust the alert
type, if needed, from the pop-up menu at the lower left of the dialog box. The alert type, which is Error by default,
specifies what kind of alert the Preflight tool displays if it finds a mismatch. You can add as many checks as
needed.
• To remove a check from the profile, select it in the left panel, and click the right-facing arrow.
• Double-click a check to edit it.

Chapter 17: Color management

Keeping colors consistent
About color management in Adobe applications
Adobe color management helps you maintain the appearance of colors as you bring images in from external sources,
edit documents and transfer them between Adobe applications, and output your finished compositions. This system is
based on conventions developed by the International Color Consortium, a group responsible for standardizing profile
formats and procedures so that consistent and accurate color can be achieved throughout a workflow.
By default, color management is turned on in color-managed Adobe applications. If you purchased the Adobe Creative
Cloud, color settings are synchronized across applications to provide consistent display for RGB and CMYK colors.
This means that colors look the same no matter which application you view them in.

If you decide to change the default settings, easy-to-use presets let you configure Adobe color management to match
common output conditions. You can also customize color settings to meet the demands of your particular color
workflow.
Keep in mind that the kinds of images you work with and your output requirements influence how you use color
management. For example, there are different color-consistency issues for an RGB photo printing workflow, a CMYK
commercial printing workflow, a mixed RGB/CMYK digital printing workflow, and an Internet publishing workflow.

Last updated 5/10/2016

569
Color management

Basic steps for producing consistent color
Consult with your production partners (if you have any) to ensure that all aspects of your color management
workflow integrate seamlessly with theirs.
Discuss how the color workflow will be integrated with your workgroups and service providers, how software and
hardware will be configured for integration into the color management system, and at what level color management
will be implemented. (See Do you need color management?.)
Calibrate and profile your monitor.
A monitor profile is the first profile you should create. Seeing accurate color is essential if you are making creative
decisions involving the color you specify in your document. (See Calibrate and profile your monitor.)
Add color profiles to your system for any input and output devices you plan to use, such as scanners and printers.
The color management system uses profiles to know how a device produces color and what the actual colors in a
document are. Device profiles are often installed when a device is added to your system. You can also use third-party
software and hardware to create more accurate profiles for specific devices and conditions. If your document will be
commercially printed, contact your service provider to determine the profile for the printing device or press condition.
(See About color profilesand Install a color profile.)
Set up color management in Adobe applications.
The default color settings are sufficient for most users. However, you can change the color settings by doing one of the
following:

• If you use multiple Adobe applications, use Adobe® Bridge to choose a standard color management configuration
and synchronize color settings across applications before working with documents. (See Synchronize color settings
across Adobe applications.)
• If you use only one Adobe application, or if you want to customize advanced color management options, you can
change color settings for a specific application. (See Set up color management.)
(Optional) Preview colors using a soft proof.
After you create a document, you can use a soft proof to preview how colors will look when printed or viewed on a
specific device. (See Proofing colors.)
Note: A soft proof alone doesn’t let you preview how overprinting will look when printed on an offset press. If you work with
documents that contain overprinting, turn on Overprint Preview to accurately preview overprints in a soft proof.
Use color management when printing and saving files.
Keeping the appearance of colors consistent across all of the devices in your workflow is the goal of color management.
Leave color management options enabled when printing documents, saving files, and preparing files for online
viewing. (See Color-managing PDFs for printing (Acrobat Pro DC)and Color-managing documents for online
viewing.)

Synchronize color settings across Adobe applications
If you use Adobe Creative Cloud, you can use Adobe Bridge CC to automatically synchronize color settings across
applications. This synchronization ensures that colors look the same in all color-managed Adobe applications.

Last updated 5/10/2016

1 Select the Color Management category of the Preferences dialog box.
2 Select a color setting from the Settings menu, and click OK.

The setting you select determines which color working spaces are used by the application, what happens when you
open and import files with embedded profiles, and how the color management system converts colors. To view a
description of a setting, select the setting and the description appears at the bottom of the dialog box.
Note: Acrobat color settings are a subset of those used in InDesign, Illustrator, and Photoshop.
In certain situations, such as if your service provider supplies you with a custom output profile, you may need to
customize specific options in the Color Settings dialog box. However, customizing is recommended for advanced
users only.
Note: If you work with more than one Adobe application, it is highly recommended that you synchronize your color
settings across applications. (See Synchronize color settings across Adobe applications.)

Managing process and spot colors
When color management is on, any color you apply or create within a color-managed Adobe application automatically
uses a color profile that corresponds to the document. If you switch color modes, the color management system uses
the appropriate profiles to translate the color to the new color model you choose.
Keep in mind the following guidelines for working with process and spot colors:

• Choose a CMYK working space that matches your CMYK output conditions to ensure that you can accurately
define and view process colors.
• Use Lab values (the default) to display predefined spot colors (such as colors from the TOYO, PANTONE, DIC, and
HKS libraries) and convert these colors to process colors. Using Lab values provides the greatest accuracy and
guarantees the consistent display of colors across Creative Cloud applications.
Note: Color-managing spot colors provides a close approximation of a spot color on your proofing device and monitor.
However, it is difficult to exactly reproduce a spot color on a monitor or proofing device because many spot color inks exist
outside the gamuts of many of those devices.

About color working spaces
A working space is an intermediate color space used to define and edit color in Adobe applications. Each color model
has a working space profile associated with it. You can choose working space profiles in the Settings menu of the Color
Management category of the Preferences dialog box.
If an object has an embedded color profile that doesn’t match the working space profile, the application uses a color
management policy to determine how to handle the color data. In most cases, the default policy is to preserve the
embedded profile.

Working space options
Select the Color Management category of the Preferences dialog box.
To view a description of any profile, select the profile. The description appears at the bottom of the dialog box.
RGB Determines the RGB color space of the application. In general, it’s best to choose Adobe RGB or sRGB, rather than

the profile for a specific device (such as a monitor profile).
sRGB is recommended when you prepare images for the web or mobile devices, because it defines the color space of
the standard monitor used to view images on the web. sRGB is also a good choice when you work with images from
consumer-level digital cameras, because most of these cameras use sRGB as their default color space.
Adobe RGB is recommended when you prepare documents for print, because Adobe RGB’s gamut includes some
printable colors (cyans and blues in particular) that can’t be defined using sRGB. Adobe RGB is also a good choice when
working with images from professional-level digital cameras, because most of these cameras use Adobe RGB as their
default color space.
CMYK Determines the CMYK color space of the application. All CMYK working spaces are device-dependent,
meaning that they are based on actual ink and paper combinations. The CMYK working spaces Adobe supplies are
based on standard commercial print conditions.
Grayscale Determines the grayscale color space of the application.

Note: You can use the color space in an embedded output color space for viewing and printing. For more information on
output intents, see Color conversion and ink management (Acrobat Pro DC) .
Adobe applications ship with a standard set of working space profiles that have been recommended and tested by
Adobe Systems for most color management workflows. By default, only these profiles appear in the working space
menus.

Color management

About missing and mismatched color profiles
Unless specified otherwise, the document uses the working space profile associated with its color mode for creating and
editing colors. However, some existing documents may not use the working space profile that you have specified, and
some existing documents may not be color-managed. It is common to encounter the following exceptions to your
color-managed workflow:

• You might open a document or import color data (for example, by copying and pasting or dragging and dropping)
from a document that is not tagged with a profile. This is often the case when you open a document created in an
application that either does not support color management or has color management turned off.
• You might open a document or import color data from a document that is tagged with a profile different from the
current working space. This may be the case when you open a document that was created using different color
management settings, or scanned and tagged with a scanner profile.
In either case, the application uses a color management policy to decide how to handle the color data in the document.

Color conversion options
Color conversion options let you control how the application handles the colors in a document as it moves from one
color space to another. Changing these options is recommended only if you are knowledgeable about color
management and very confident about the changes you make. To display conversion options, select the Color
Management category of the Preferences dialog box.
Engine Specifies the Color Management Module (CMM) used to map the gamut of one color space to the gamut of

another. For most users, the default Adobe (ACE) engine fulfills all conversion needs.
To view a description of an engine or intent option, select the option. The description appears at the bottom of the dialog
box.
Use Black Point Compensation Ensures that the shadow detail in the image is preserved by simulating the full dynamic
range of the output device. Select this option if you plan to use black point compensation when printing (which is
recommended in most situations).

About rendering intents
A rendering intent determines how a color management system handles color conversion from one color space to
another. Different rendering intents use different rules to determine how the source colors are adjusted; for example,
colors that fall inside the destination gamut may remain unchanged, or they may be adjusted to preserve the original
range of visual relationships when translated to a smaller destination gamut. The result of choosing a rendering intent
depends on the graphical content of documents and on the profiles used to specify color spaces. Some profiles produce
identical results for different rendering intents.
In general, it is best to use the default rendering intent for the selected color setting, which has been tested by Adobe
Systems to meet industry standards. For example, if you choose a color setting for North America or Europe, the default
rendering intent is Relative Colorimetric.. If you choose a color setting for Japan, the default rendering intent is Perceptual.
You can select a rendering intent when you set color conversion options for the color management system, soft-proof
colors, and print artwork:
Perceptual Aims to preserve the visual relationship between colors so it’s perceived as natural to the human eye, even

though the color values themselves may change. This intent is suitable for photographic images with lots of out-ofgamut colors. This is the standard rendering intent for the Japanese printing industry.

Color management

Saturation Tries to produce vivid colors in an image at the expense of color accuracy. This rendering intent is suitable
for business graphics like graphs or charts, where bright saturated colors are more important than the exact relationship
between colors.
Relative Colorimetric Compares the extreme highlight of the source color space to that of the destination color space
and shifts all colors accordingly. Out-of-gamut colors are shifted to the closest reproducible color in the destination
color space. Relative Colorimetric preserves more of the original colors in an image than Perceptual. This is the
standard rendering intent for printing in North America and Europe.
Absolute Colorimetric Leaves colors that fall inside the destination gamut unchanged. Out-of-gamut colors are clipped.
No scaling of colors to destination white point is performed. This intent aims to maintain color accuracy at the expense
of preserving relationships between colors and is suitable for proofing to simulate the output of a particular device. This
intent is particularly useful for previewing how paper color affects printed colors.

Color-managing documents
Color-managing documents for online viewing
Color management for online viewing is very different from color management for printed media. With printed media,
you have far more control over the appearance of the final document. With online media, your document will appear
on a wide range of possibly uncalibrated monitors and video display systems, significantly limiting your control over
color consistency.
When you color-manage documents that are viewed exclusively on the web, Adobe recommends that you use the sRGB
color space. sRGB is the default working space for most Adobe color settings, but you can verify that sRGB is selected
in the Color Management preferences. With the working space set to sRGB, any RGB graphics you create will use sRGB
as the color space.
When you export PDFs, you can choose to embed profiles. PDFs with embedded profiles reproduce color consistently
under a properly configured color management system. Keep in mind that embedding color profiles increases the size
of PDFs. RGB profiles are usually small (around 3 KB); however, CMYK profiles can range from 0.5 to 2 MB.

Proofing colors
In a traditional publishing workflow, you print a hard proof of your document to preview how its colors look when
reproduced on a specific output device. In a color-managed workflow, you can use the precision of color profiles to softproof your document directly on the monitor. You can display an onscreen preview of how your document’s colors look
when reproduced on a particular output device.
Keep in mind that the reliability of the soft proof depends upon the quality of your monitor, the profiles of your monitor
and output devices, and the ambient lighting conditions of your work environment.
Note: A soft proof alone doesn’t let you preview how overprinting looks when printed on an offset press. If you work with
documents that contain overprinting, turn on Overprint Preview to accurately preview overprints in a soft proof.

A Document is created in its working color space. B Document’s color values are translated to color space of chosen proof profile (usually the
output device’s profile). C Monitor displays proof profile’s interpretation of document’s color values.

Soft-proof colors (Acrobat Pro DC)
1 Choose Tools &amp;gt; Print Production. The Print Production tools are displayed in the right-hand pane.
2 In the right-pane, click Output Preview.
3 Choose the color profile of a specific output device from the Simulation Profile menu.
4 Choose any additional soft-proof options:
Simulate Black Ink Simulates the dark gray you really get instead of a solid black on many printers, according to the
proof profile. Not all profiles support this option.
Simulate Paper Color Simulates the dingy white of real paper, according to the proof profile. Not all profiles support

this option.

Color-managing PDFs for printing (Acrobat Pro DC)
When you create Adobe PDFs for commercial printing, you can specify how color information is represented. The
easiest way to do this is using a PDF/X standard. For more information about PDF/X and how to create PDFs, search
Help.
In general, you have the following choices for handling colors when creating PDFs:

• (PDF/X-3) Does not convert colors. Use this method when creating a document that is printed or displayed on
various or unknown devices. When you select a PDF/X-3 standard, color profiles are automatically embedded in
the PDF.
• (PDF/X-1a) Converts all colors to the destination CMYK color space. Use this method if you want to create a pressready file that does not require any further color conversions. When you select a PDF/X-1a standard, no profiles are
embedded in the PDF.
Note: All spot color information is preserved during color conversion; only the process color equivalents convert to the
designated color space.

Working with color profiles

About color profiles
Precise, consistent color management requires accurate ICC-compliant profiles of all of your color devices. For
example, without an accurate scanner profile, a perfectly scanned image may appear incorrect in another program,
simply due to any difference between the scanner and the program displaying the image. This misleading
representation may cause you to make unnecessary, time-wasting, and potentially damaging “corrections” to an already
satisfactory image. With an accurate profile, a program importing the image can correct for any device differences and
display a scan’s actual colors.
A color management system uses the following kinds of profiles:
Monitor profiles Describe how the monitor is currently reproducing color. This is the first profile you should create

because viewing color accurately on your monitor allows for critical color decisions in the design process. If what you
see on your monitor is not representative of the actual colors in your document, you will not be able to maintain color
consistency.
Input device profiles Describe what colors an input device is capable of capturing or scanning. If your digital camera
offers a choice of profiles, Adobe recommends that you select Adobe RGB. Otherwise, use sRGB (which is the default
for most cameras). Advanced users may also consider using different profiles for different light sources. For scanner
profiles, some photographers create separate profiles for each type or brand of film scanned on a scanner.
Output device profiles Describe the color space of output devices like desktop printers or a printing press. The color

management system uses output device profiles to properly map the colors in a document to the colors within the
gamut of an output device’s color space. The output profile should also take into consideration specific printing
conditions, such as the type of paper and ink. For example, glossy paper is capable of displaying a different range of
colors than matte paper.
Most printer drivers come with built-in color profiles. It’s a good idea to try these profiles before you invest in custom
profiles.
Document profiles (Not applicable to PDFs) Define the specific RGB or CMYK color space of a document. By
assigning, or tagging, a document with a profile, the application provides a definition of actual color appearances in the
document. For example, R=127, G=12, B=107 is just a set of numbers that different devices will display differently. But
when tagged with the Adobe RGB color space, these numbers specify an actual color or wavelength of light—in this
case, a specific color of purple.

When color management is on, Adobe applications automatically assign new documents a profile based on Working
Space options in the Color Settings dialog box. Documents without assigned profiles are known as untagged and
contain only raw color numbers. When working with untagged documents, Adobe applications use the current
working space profile to display and edit colors.

A Profiles describe the color spaces of the input device and the document. B Using the profiles’ descriptions, the color management system
identifies the document’s actual colors. C The monitor’s profile tells the color management system how to translate the document’s numeric values
to the monitor’s color space. D Using the output device’s profile, the color management system translates the document’s numeric values to the
color values of the output device so the correct appearance of colors is printed.

About monitor calibration and characterization
Profiling software can both calibrate and characterize your monitor. Calibrating your monitor brings it into compliance
with a predefined standard—for example, adjusting your monitor so that it displays color using the graphics arts
standard white point color temperature of 5000° K (Kelvin). Characterizing your monitor simply creates a profile that
describes how the monitor is currently reproducing color.
Monitor calibration involves adjusting the following video settings:
Brightness and contrast The overall level and range, respectively, of display intensity. These parameters work just as
they do on a television. A monitor calibration utility helps you set an optimum brightness and contrast range for
calibration.
Gamma The brightness of the midtone values. The values produced by a monitor from black to white are nonlinear—
if you graph the values, they form a curve, not a straight line. Gamma defines the value of that curve halfway between
black and white.
Phosphors The substances that CRT monitors use to emit light. Different phosphors have different color
characteristics.
White point The color and intensity of the brightest white the monitor can reproduce.

Calibrate and profile your monitor
When you calibrate your monitor, you are adjusting it so it conforms to a known specification. Once your monitor is
calibrated, the profiling utility lets you save a color profile. The profile describes the color behavior of the monitor—
what colors can or cannot be displayed on the monitor and how the numeric color values in an image must be converted
so that colors are displayed accurately.
1 Make sure your monitor has been turned on for at least half an hour. This gives it sufficient time to warm up and

produce more consistent output.

Color management

2 Make sure your monitor is displaying thousands of colors or more. Ideally, make sure it is displaying millions of

colors or 24-bit or higher.
3 Remove colorful background patterns on your monitor desktop and set your desktop to display neutral grays. Busy

patterns or bright colors surrounding a document interfere with accurate color perception.
4 Do one of the following to calibrate and profile your monitor:

• In Windows, install and use a monitor calibration utility.
• In Mac OS, use the Calibrate utility, located on the System Preferences/Displays/Color tab.
• For the best results, use third-party software and measuring devices. In general, using a measuring device such
as a colorimeter along with software can create more accurate profiles because an instrument can measure the
colors displayed on a monitor far more accurately than the human eye.
Note: Monitor performance changes and declines over time; recalibrate and profile your monitor every month or so. If
you find it difficult or impossible to calibrate your monitor to a standard, it may be too old and faded.
Most profiling software automatically assigns the new profile as the default monitor profile. For instructions on how to
manually assign the monitor profile, refer to the Help system for your operating system.

Install a color profile
Color profiles are often installed when a device is added to your system. The accuracy of these profiles (often called
generic profiles or canned profiles) varies from manufacturer to manufacturer. You can also obtain device profiles from
your service provider, download profiles from the web, or create custom profiles using professional profiling equipment.

• In Windows, right-click a profile and select Install Profile. Alternatively, copy the profiles into the
WINDOWS\system32\spool\drivers\color folder.
• In Mac OS, copy profiles into the /Library/ColorSync/Profiles folder or the
/Users/[username]/Library/ColorSync/Profiles folder.
After installing color profiles, be sure to restart Adobe applications.

Embed a color profile
You can embed a color profile in an object. Acrobat attaches the appropriate profile, as specified in the Convert Colors
dialog box, to the selected objects in the PDF. For more information, see Color conversion and ink management
(Acrobat Pro DC) .

Convert colors to another profile (Acrobat Pro DC)
You convert colors in a PDF using the Convert Colors tool available in Print Production. For more information, see
Color conversion and ink management (Acrobat Pro DC) .

Understanding color management
A color management system reconciles color differences among devices so that you can be reasonably certain of the
colors your system ultimately produces. Viewing color accurately allows you to make sound color decisions throughout
your workflow, from digital capture through final output. Color management also allows you to create output based on
ISO, SWOP, and Japan Color print production standards.

Why colors sometimes don’t match
No device in a publishing system is capable of reproducing the full range of colors viewable to the human eye. Each
device operates within a specific color space that can produce a certain range, or gamut, of colors.
A color model determines the relationship between values, and the color space defines the absolute meaning of those
values as colors. Some color models (such as CIE L*a*b) have a fixed color space because they relate directly to the way
humans perceive color. These models are described as being device-independent. Other color models (RGB, HSL, HSB,
CMYK, and so forth) can have many different color spaces. Because these models vary with each associated color space
or device, they are described as being device-dependent.
Because of these varying color spaces, colors can shift in appearance as you transfer documents between different
devices. Color variations can result from differences in image sources; the way software applications define color; print
media (newsprint paper reproduces a smaller gamut than magazine-quality paper); and other natural variations, such
as manufacturing differences in monitors or monitor age.

A Lab color space B Documents (working space) C Devices

What is a color management system?
Color-matching problems result from various devices and software using different color spaces. One solution is to have
a system that interprets and translates color accurately between devices. A color management system (CMS) compares
the color space in which a color was created to the color space in which the same color will be output, and makes the
necessary adjustments to represent the color as consistently as possible among different devices.

Color management

A color management system translates colors with the help of color profiles. A profile is a mathematical description of
a device’s color space. For example, a scanner profile tells a color management system how your scanner “sees” colors.
Adobe color management uses ICC profiles, a format defined by the International Color Consortium (ICC) as a crossplatform standard.
Because no single color-translation method is ideal for all types of graphics, a color management system provides a
choice of rendering intents, or translation methods, so that you can apply a method appropriate to a particular graphics
element. For example, a color translation method that preserves correct relationships among colors in a wildlife
photograph may alter the colors in a logo containing flat tints of color.
Note: Don’t confuse color management with color correction. A color management system won’t correct an image that was
saved with tonal or color balance problems. It provides an environment where you can evaluate images reliably in the
context of your final output.

Do you need color management?
Without a color management system, your color specifications are device-dependent. You might not need color
management if your production process is tightly controlled for one medium only. For example, you or your print
service provider can tailor CMYK images and specify color values for a known, specific set of printing conditions.
The value of color management increases when you have more variables in your production process. Color
management is recommended if you anticipate reusing color graphics for print and online media, using various kinds
of devices within a single medium (such as different printing presses), or if you manage multiple workstations.
You will benefit from a color management system if you need to accomplish any of the following:

• Get predictable and consistent color output on multiple output devices including color separations, your desktop
printer, and your monitor. Color management is especially useful for adjusting color for devices with a relatively
limited gamut, such as a four-color process printing press.
• Accurately soft-proof (preview) a color document on your monitor by making it simulate a specific output device.
(Soft-proofing is subject to the limitations of monitor display, and other factors such as room lighting conditions.)
• Accurately evaluate and consistently incorporate color graphics from many different sources if they also use color
management, and even in some cases if they don’t.
• Send color documents to different output devices and media without having to manually adjust colors in documents
or original graphics. This is valuable when creating images that will eventually be used both in print and online.
• Print color correctly to an unknown color output device; for example, you could store a document online for
consistently reproducible on-demand color printing anywhere in the world.

Creating a viewing environment for color management
Your work environment influences how you see color on your monitor and on printed output. For best results, control
the colors and light in your work environment by doing the following:

• View your documents in an environment that provides a consistent light level and color temperature. For example,
the color characteristics of sunlight change throughout the day and alter the way colors appear on your screen, so
keep shades closed or work in a windowless room. To eliminate the blue-green cast from fluorescent lighting, you
can install D50 (5000° Kelvin) lighting. You can also view printed documents using a D50 lightbox.
• View your document in a room with neutral-colored walls and ceiling. A room’s color can affect the perception of
both monitor color and printed color. The best color for a viewing room is neutral gray. Also, the color of your
clothing reflecting off the glass of your monitor may affect the appearance of colors on-screen.

Color management

• Remove colorful background patterns on your monitor desktop. Busy or bright patterns surrounding a document
interfere with accurate color perception. Set your desktop to display neutral grays only.
• View document proofs in the real-world conditions under which your audience will see the final piece. For example,
you might want to see how a housewares catalog looks under the incandescent light bulbs used in homes, or view
an office furniture catalog under the fluorescent lighting used in offices. However, always make final color
judgements under the lighting conditions specified by the legal requirements for contract proofs in your country.
