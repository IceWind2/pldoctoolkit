The aim of the project is to create an Eclipse plugin to support text and visual editing and validating of DRL documents.

DRL stands for 'Document Reuse Language' - a special document markup language incorporating docbook features, designed for creating documentation for a series of highly-interrelated software products, otherwise known as 'Product Line'.
